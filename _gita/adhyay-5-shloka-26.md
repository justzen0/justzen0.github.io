### Osho’s Commentary
For those who are free from desire and anger, whose minds are stilled, and who have known the Self—for them, the supreme bliss is not a distant goal. It is abhito, all around them, here and now.
We are living in an ocean of bliss, but we are not aware of it because our minds are so full of the noise of desire and anger. When this noise subsides, when the mind becomes silent, you suddenly discover that what you were seeking was always here. You were just not available to it. For the one who has known himself, the whole of existence reveals itself as an ocean of bliss.
