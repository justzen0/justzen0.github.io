### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna speaks, and his first word is the key: Anugraha, grace. He says, “By the words spoken out of grace for me, my ignorance has been destroyed.” This is the mark of a true disciple, a worthy vessel. He does not claim this understanding as his own achievement. He does not say, “I have understood.” He says, “It has been given.”
The ego is an upside-down pot. The rain of grace may fall, but the pot remains empty. The ego always claims, “I have done it.” But Arjuna is a patra, a worthy one, precisely because he knows his own unworthiness. His pot is upright, open, ready to receive. He says, “It is your grace, Krishna, not my effort.”
And he says he has heard of the origin and dissolution of beings from Krishna. This is the great puzzle. A seeker wants to know: what is the secret of this existence? We know of two streams of thought. One says God is a creator, a maker, like a potter making a pot. This is the view of the ego, for it places the creator outside his creation. The other, deeper view is that the divine is creativity itself. He is not the painter, but the painting. The dancer, but also the dance. Existence is not his product; it is his very being. Arjuna says, "I have heard this from you." He has heard, but he has not yet seen. The journey from hearing to seeing is the greatest journey there is.
