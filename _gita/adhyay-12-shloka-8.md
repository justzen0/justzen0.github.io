> Fix the mind on Me alone; in Me alone let the intellect rest. There is no doubt that hereafter you will dwell in Me alone.

### Osho’s Commentary
Fix your mind on me, let your intellect enter into me. And then, you will live in me alone. There is no doubt.
Krishna gives the method. First, the mind. Let your thoughts flow towards me. Let me be the object of your contemplation. But this is not enough, because the intellect, the buddhi, can still stand apart, analyzing, doubting.
So, the second step is to let your intellect also enter into me. It is not just to think about me, but to think from me. It is a total merger of your reasoning faculty with the divine. When your heart and your head are both flowing in the same direction, when there is no inner conflict, then the union is complete.
Then you will not just visit me in moments of prayer. You will live in me. Your very being will find its home in the divine. This is not a promise for some future heaven. It is a reality that can be experienced here and now.
