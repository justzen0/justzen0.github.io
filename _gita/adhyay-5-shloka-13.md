### Osho’s Commentary
He who has renounced all actions in his mind rests happily. The renunciation is mental, not necessarily physical.
He rests in the city of nine gates, navadvare pure. This body is a city with nine openings—two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, and the two organs of excretion and generation. The soul, the dehi, the dweller in this city, is separate from it.
He who has realized this separation, who knows that he is not the city but the dweller, he rests in happiness. He neither acts nor causes action. Actions happen through the body, the city, but he, the king seated on the throne within, remains a silent witness. He is at peace, the master of his own being.
