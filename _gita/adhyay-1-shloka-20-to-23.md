### Osho’s Commentary
And now Arjuna, the man of thought, of awareness, makes his first move. He does not rush into battle. He asks Krishna, his charioteer, his inner consciousness, to place his chariot between the two armies.
He says, "Let me see who these people are, who have gathered here, eager to fight." This is the mark of a thoughtful man. A blind warrior rushes in; a conscious warrior first observes. He wants to be a witness. He is not possessed by the fever of war. He is in a state of cool observation.
This very desire to see, to observe, is the seed of the whole Gita. If Arjuna were like Bhima or Duryodhana, there would have been a great battle, but no Gita. The Gita is born out of this pause, this moment of reflection.
The violent man never sees his enemy. He projects his own hatred, his own anger, and creates an enemy where there may be none. Arjuna wants to see the real faces. He says, "Let me look upon those with whom I have to fight." This is a dangerous desire for a warrior. Because when you truly look at your enemy, you may see his humanity. You may see his eyes, his fears, his hopes. You may see a brother. And then, to kill becomes impossible. Arjuna, by asking to see, is unknowingly stepping onto a path that will lead him away from war and into a deep inner crisis.
