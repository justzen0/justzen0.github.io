### Osho’s Commentary
The final chapter of Krishna’s song has arrived. And what begins must also end. The words of even the most unique beings are like lines drawn on water. But do not be mistaken. My words, your words, are just empty bubbles. Krishna’s words are bubbles that reflect the eternal moon. Do not get caught in the bubble, my friend. See the reflection, and then turn your back to the lake and begin the journey towards the moon itself.
Arjuna stands at the very precipice. His journey from being a friend to a disciple is complete. His questions are no longer of the mind, but of the soul. He asks the ultimate question: What is renunciation? What is abandonment? This is the final inquiry, for the eighteenth chapter is named Moksha-Sannyasa-Yoga—the yoga of liberation and renunciation.
India’s vision soars beyond all others. The world stops at dharma, at religion. But India says even dharma is a beautiful bondage. The ultimate is moksha, a freedom so total that all identities—Hindu, Muslim, Christian—dissolve. You become one with the whole. And the path to this ultimate freedom is sannyas.
Krishna begins by laying out the different views. Some say sannyas is the renunciation of desire-filled actions (kamya karma)—not the necessary actions of life, but those born of the ego’s madness for more. A beautiful path. Others, the wise, say it is not about renouncing action, but renouncing the fruit of action. A subtler, more difficult path. And still others say all action is flawed, so renounce everything! While some insist that the sacred acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity must never be abandoned.
Krishna is not giving one answer. He is opening all the doors. He is showing Arjuna the entire landscape of human seeking.
