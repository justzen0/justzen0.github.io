> Supreme Bliss comes to this yogi alone whose mind has become perfectly tranquil, whose quality of rajas has been eliminated, who has become identified with Brahman, and is untainted.

### Osho’s Commentary
Supreme happiness comes to the yogi whose mind is utterly peaceful. His passion, his rajas, is stilled. He has become one with the divine, free from all sin.
Sin is not an act; it is a state of being out of tune. When you are perfectly in tune with the whole, when your mind is silent and your passions are at rest, you are in a state of sinlessness.
In that state of purity and harmony, the supreme bliss descends upon you. It is not something that you achieve; it is a gift of grace that comes when you are utterly empty and receptive.
