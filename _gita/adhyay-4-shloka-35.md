> Knowing this, O Pandava, you will not be deluded again in this way, and through it, you will see all beings, without exception, in the Self and also in Me.

### Osho’s Commentary
When this knowledge dawns, delusion disappears forever. And what is the nature of this vision?
First, you will see all beings, bhutanyasheshena, without any exception, in your own Self, atmani. The sense of separation dissolves. You see the whole of existence as a manifestation of your own deepest being. The trees, the stars, the animals, other people—they are all within you.
And then, atho mayi, and then in Me. When you have seen the whole universe within yourself, the final step is to see your own self within the divine. The personal dissolves into the universal. The drop disappears into the ocean. There is no longer "you" and "me". There is only one, undivided, blissful existence.
