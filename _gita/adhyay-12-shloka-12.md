> Knowledge is certainly superior to practice; meditation surpasses knowledge. The renunciation of the results of works surpasses meditation. From renunciation, peace follows immediately.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now gives the hierarchy of the path.
Knowledge is better than blind, mechanical practice.
Meditation is better than mere intellectual knowledge.
And the renunciation of the fruit of action is better even than meditation. Why? Because from this renunciation, peace comes anantaram, immediately, without any delay.
In meditation, there is still a subtle effort, a subtle desire to attain something. But in the renunciation of the fruit, all desire is dropped. And peace is not a goal to be achieved; it is the natural state of a desireless mind.
It is like this: you are running, and you are creating a great disturbance around you. The moment you stop running, the dust settles, and silence descends. The renunciation of the fruit is this stopping. In that very stopping, the peace that you were seeking is found to be already there.
