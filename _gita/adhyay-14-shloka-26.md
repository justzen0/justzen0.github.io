### Osho’s Commentary
And now, Krishna gives the simplest and most direct path to transcendence: the path of devotion.
He who serves me with an unswerving love, avyabhicharena bhakti-yogena—a love that does not waver, that is not divided—he too crosses beyond the three gunas and becomes ready to merge with Brahman.
This is the path of the heart. It is not a path of will or of struggle. It is a path of letting go, of surrender. When your love for the divine becomes so total that there is no room for anything else, then in that very fire of love, all the gunas are burned. The ego dissolves, and you become one with the beloved. This is the ultimate alchemy of love.
