### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna continues, “If I were to stop acting, everyone would follow my path.”
Imagine if the sun decided to stop shining. The whole solar system would collapse into darkness and chaos. Krishna is like the sun for humanity. If he were to become inactive, the whole moral and spiritual order of the world would be shaken.
People would say, “If even Krishna does not act, why should we?” Laziness would become a virtue. Inaction would be seen as the highest goal. The world would fall into a state of inertia, of tamas.
The presence of an enlightened being is a great inspiration. His tireless action, performed without any selfish motive, becomes a source of energy for the whole world. He keeps the wheel of dharma moving. If he were to stop, the wheel would grind to a halt, and humanity would lose its way.
