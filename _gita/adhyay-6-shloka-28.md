### Osho’s Commentary
The yogi who is free from sin, who is constantly keeping his self in tune, easily, sukhena, enjoys the supreme bliss of contact with the divine.
The path is not difficult; we make it difficult. The divine is not far away; we have just turned our backs to it.
When the mind is purified of all sin—which means, of all ego, all selfishness—and is constantly in a state of yoga, of union, then the contact with the divine happens easily, joyfully. It is not a struggle; it is a natural flowering.
