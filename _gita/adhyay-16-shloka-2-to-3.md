### Osho’s Commentary
Ahimsa, non-violence. Do you think it is about what you eat or what you don’t eat? No, my friend. True non-violence begins with a deep empathy. It begins when you feel joy in another’s joy. We are masters of feeling sympathy for another’s misery; it gives our ego a subtle nourishment. But to rejoice in another’s success, in another’s happiness—that is the beginning of true non-violence.
Satya, truth. Not just speaking the truth, but being authentic. To be the same inside and out, without any concern for the consequences. Truth is not a policy; it is your very being.
Akrodha, absence of anger. This is not the suppression of anger. Anger is our constant state, a simmering fire. Akrodha is a state of deep tranquility where the very possibility of anger does not arise. It comes from the understanding that everyone is moving according to their own nature, their own destiny. You are not the center of the world.
Tyaga, renunciation. There is a joy in possessing, and there is a far deeper joy in letting go. Tyaga is the fragrance of a life of giving, of sharing. The more you give, the more you have. The more you cling, the more you lose.
Shanti, peace. This is not something to be sought when you are in turmoil. It is a quality to be cultivated in your moments of stillness. It is to create a shield of awareness around you, so the madness of the world cannot penetrate your inner sanctum.
And compassion, gentleness, modesty, vigor, forgiveness... this whole bouquet of flowers blossoms in the one who is walking the path of divine wealth.
