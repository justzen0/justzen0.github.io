### Osho’s Commentary
This is a very subtle and compassionate teaching. The wise man should not disturb the faith of the ignorant.
The ignorant man is attached to his actions, to his rituals, to his beliefs. This is his reality. If a wise man comes and tells him, “All this is meaningless, all this is an illusion,” he will only shatter the man’s world without being able to give him a new one. He will destroy the man’s small, flickering lamp, and the man will be left in total darkness.
Krishna says this is not the way. The wise man should not create a buddhibhedam, a division in the intellect, of the ignorant. He should not preach high philosophy to those who are not ready for it.
Instead, he should act alongside them, performing all actions with the spirit of yoga, with centeredness and detachment. By his own example, by his own radiance, he should gently inspire them to bring a new quality to their own actions. He should not take away their work, but show them a new way of working.
A wise man is not a destroyer. He is a skillful guide. He meets people where they are and gently leads them towards the light.
