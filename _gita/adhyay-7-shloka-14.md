### Osho’s Commentary
This illusion, this maya, is difficult to cross. Why? Because you are trying to fight it with your own strength. And your strength is also a part of maya. It is like trying to lift yourself up by your own shoelaces. It is impossible.
If you fight nature, you will be defeated, because you are a tiny part of it. A small wave cannot fight the whole ocean.
So what is the way? Krishna says, mam eva ye prapadyante—those who take refuge in Me alone. This is the path of surrender. It is to stop fighting, to stop struggling, and to simply let go into the hands of the divine.
It is to say, “I cannot do it. Thy will be done.” In that moment of total surrender, a miracle happens. The divine energy begins to flow through you. The wave relaxes and realizes it is the ocean. It is no longer a fight, but a love affair. And in that love, this great illusion is easily crossed.
