> One who has their mind Self-absorbed through Yoga, and who has the vision of sameness everywhere, sees this Self existing in everything, and everything in their Self.<br><br>One who sees Me in everything and sees all things in Me—I do not lose sight of him, and he also is not lost to My vision.

### Osho’s Commentary
Here is the ultimate vision of the yogi. He sees his own Self in all beings, and all beings in his own Self. He sees the same divine reality everywhere.
The illusion of separation has vanished. The tree, the rock, the animal, the other person—they are all manifestations of the one Self.
And he who sees Me, the divine, in everything, and sees everything in Me—for him, I am never lost, and he is never lost to Me.
This is the ultimate love affair, the ultimate union. The drop has disappeared into the ocean, and the ocean has disappeared into the drop. There is no longer any separation. This is the goal of all seeking—to realize this profound, blissful oneness of all existence.
