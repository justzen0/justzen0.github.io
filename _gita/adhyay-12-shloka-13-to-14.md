### Osho’s Commentary
Who is this devotee that is dear to me? Krishna now paints a beautiful portrait of the one who is beloved of God.
He is adveshta, without any ill will, even to those who harm him. He is friendly and compassionate to all.
He is free from the illusion of “I” and “mine,” free from ego and possessiveness.
He is balanced in pleasure and pain, forgiving.
He is ever-content, self-controlled, of firm resolve.
And his mind and intellect are offered to me.
This is the man who has become a clear channel for the divine. His own small self has been set aside, and the love and peace of the divine flows through him. He is not just one who prays to God; he has become a living prayer. Such a one, says Krishna, is dear to me.
