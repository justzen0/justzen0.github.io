> I am delighted by seeing something I have not seen before, and my mind is stricken with fear. O Lord, show me that very form; O Supreme God, O Abode of the Universe, be gracious!

### Osho’s Commentary
I am delighted to have seen what was never seen before, but my mind is also terrified. Please show me your other form.
Arjuna is caught between two poles. The delight of seeing the infinite, and the terror of it. The human mind cannot bear this paradox for long. It wants to return to a more manageable reality.
He is asking Krishna to withdraw his cosmic form and to return to his familiar, four-armed form. He is asking for the infinite to put on its veil again, so that he can relate to it without being shattered. This is a very poignant moment. Man seeks the ultimate truth, but when he finds it, he finds it unbearable.
