### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna continues to paint the portrait of the liberated man.
Nirashi—He is without hope, without expectation. He lives in the present. The future does not exist for him.
Yatachittatma—His mind and self are under perfect control. He is the master in his own house.
Tyaktasarvaparigrahah—He has renounced all sense of possession. He may use things, but he does not own them. He knows that nothing is his.
Such a man performs action shariram kevalam karma—by the body alone. His action is purely physical. His being, his soul, is not involved as a doer. It remains a detached witness. And so, he incurs no sin, no karma. Action performed in such a state of consciousness is pure; it leaves no trace, no residue. It is like writing on water.
