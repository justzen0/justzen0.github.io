> The supreme Self of one who has control over the aggregate of his body and organs, and who is tranquil, becomes manifest. He should be poised in the midst of cold and heat, happiness and sorrow, as well as honor and dishonor.

### Osho’s Commentary
He who has conquered himself and is utterly peaceful—for him, the Supreme Reality is ever-present, ever-balanced. He is undisturbed by the pairs of opposites.
What is the source of our disturbance? It is not the outer event—the pleasure or the pain. The source is our identification with it. When pain comes, we don’t just say, “Pain is here.” We say, “I AM in pain.” We become the pain.
The wise one is a witness. He stands on the bank of the river of life. He watches the pleasure and pain flow by, but he does not jump into the river. He remains untouched, serene.
This is the art of yoga—to remain a witness. When you are a witness, the dualities of the world cannot disturb your inner peace. In that serene, balanced state of being, the Supreme Self is revealed. It was always there; you were just too agitated to see it.
