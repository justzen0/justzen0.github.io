### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna says, “It is so, Krishna, just as you say.” The trust is complete. The acceptance is total. But… there is a great “but.” He says, Drashtum icchami—“I wish to see.”
This is a tremendous leap. It is the move from belief to knowing, from faith to experience. Hearing is not enough. The words of a Krishna are beautiful, but they can only create a thirst; they cannot quench it. One can live a whole life believing in the words of others, but such a life is built on a foundation of sand.
Arjuna is now asking for direct perception. He says, “I want to see with my own eyes.” This is the ultimate audacity, the most dangerous desire a man can have. Because to see the Virat, the universal form, is to invite a fire that can consume you. Your small, human eyes are not made to behold the infinite. To see it, you will have to die. The old Arjuna will have to disappear. It is a quest that begins with a longing to see and ends in the annihilation of the seer. Arjuna, perhaps unknowingly, is asking for his own death.
