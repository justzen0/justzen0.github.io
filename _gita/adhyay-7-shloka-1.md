### Osho’s Commentary
Religion, in its essence, is a love-filled affirmation of life. The ego denies; humility accepts. And Krishna says to Arjuna, “Listen, only if you are filled with a love and a trust for me that is ananya—a love of non-otherness.”
What is this love of non-otherness?
In ordinary love—a father for a son, a lover for the beloved—a wall always remains. It may be transparent, but the separation is there. Two remain two. That is love. But where the two dissolve, where only one remains, that is prayer.
This state of non-otherness is possible only with the divine, not with a person. Why? Because a person is a boundary, a limitation. When two boundaries meet, they can only clash. The closer human lovers come, the more they feel the vast, unbridgeable chasm between them. This is the agony of love.
Krishna speaks of a love where not just the wall, but the two people on either side of it, dissolve. Vedanta has a beautiful word for this: Advaita, not-two. It does not say ‘one’, my friend, for one cannot exist without the other. It simply says, the duality will be no more. Do not think that when the other disappears, you will remain. No! You and the other are two sides of the same coin. When the lover and the beloved are gone, only Love remains.
This is why all our worldly loves turn to poison. Where there is an ‘I’ and a ‘you’, there is a struggle for ownership, a subtle violence. But one who is filled with this non-dual love for me, says Krishna, to him I will reveal the ultimate.
