### Osho’s Commentary
This is the very heart of the Gita's message on action. Your right is to the work, but never to the fruit.
This is a revolutionary statement. Our whole life is oriented towards the fruit, the result. We act only for the sake of what we will get. And because of this, our action is always filled with anxiety, with tension.
Krishna is teaching the art of acting with total absorption in the present moment, without any concern for the future. Let the action itself be your joy, your reward.
And do not be attached to inaction either. To renounce action out of laziness or fear is not the way.
Be established in yoga, perform your actions, abandoning attachment, and being the same in success and failure. This evenness of mind is called yoga.
Action done with a desire for the fruit is far inferior to the yoga of wisdom. Seek refuge in wisdom. Pitiful are those who work for the fruit.
The one who is united with wisdom casts off both good and evil deeds here itself. Therefore, devote yourself to yoga. Yoga is skill in action.
The wise, united with wisdom, having abandoned the fruit of action, and freed from the bondage of birth, go to the state beyond all sorrow.
