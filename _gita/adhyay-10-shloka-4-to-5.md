### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna says to Arjuna, “Intellect, knowledge, freedom from delusion…” These three words are of immense value.
Intellect! Our mind, as we have it, is a mind of non-determination. It is never whole. Even when it decides, the decision is always democratic, a decision of the majority. A part of the mind is always in opposition. A mind that is whole, where no part is in opposition, becomes determination. When the mind is complete, it disappears. An incomplete mind is what we call the mind.
When this happens, knowledge is born. And through knowledge comes non-delusion. A mind that is deluded lives in confusion, asleep. A man can be walking on the road, but he is walking in his sleep. His mind is a constant dream. To be non-deluded is to be awake.
And then Krishna says, “Forgiveness is in me.” But the forgiveness we know is not Krishna’s forgiveness. We get angry, then we repent, then we forgive. Krishna’s forgiveness is the absence of anger. It is a state where no reaction of anger arises. It is like this: you throw a stone into the empty sky. Nothing happens. You throw a stone into a silent lake, and a thousand ripples arise. A silent man, a non-deluded man, is like the sky. A deluded man is like a lake of disturbed thoughts.
When you are insulted, and you feel anger, do not think the other has created it. The other has only been instrumental. The anger was already there, hidden inside you. He has only provided the occasion for it to come out. Krishna’s forgiveness is the state in which there is no anger within.
And all these qualities, says Krishna—equanimity, contentment, austerity, fame, infamy, pleasure, pain—all arise from Me. We see a world of fragments. Krishna sees a world that is whole. Arjuna sees friend and foe. Krishna sees only the one, hidden behind all forms. When Arjuna can see the whole, all questions of conflict will drop.
