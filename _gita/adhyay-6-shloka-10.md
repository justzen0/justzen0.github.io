> A yogi should constantly concentrate his mind by staying in a solitary place, alone, with mind and body controlled, free from expectations, and free from acquisition.

### Osho’s Commentary
The yogi should constantly engage his being, remaining in rahasya, in solitude. But what is this solitude?
It is not just being physically alone in a forest or a cave. You can be alone in a crowd, and you can be in a crowd while alone in a cave. The real solitude is inner. It is a state where the other has disappeared from your consciousness. You are so centered in your own being that the world of others simply does not enter. This is ekaki, being alone.
And in this inner aloneness, the mind and self are controlled. He is nirashi, without hope, without desire for the future. He is aparigrahah, without possessions.
When these conditions are met—inner solitude, self-control, freedom from hope and possessions—the mind can be constantly yoked to the Self. This is the state of meditation.
