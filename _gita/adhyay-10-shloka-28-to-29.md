### Osho’s Commentary
Of all weapons, Krishna chooses the thunderbolt, the vajra, the weapon of Indra. It represents an irresistible, concentrated power.
Of all cows, he is the Kamadhenu, the mythological wish-fulfilling cow.
And then, a most significant statement: "I am Kandarpa, the god of love, who is the cause of procreation." In other words, he is saying, "I am Kamadeva." This is a revolutionary declaration for a religion. Most religions have condemned Kama, desire, as the enemy. But Krishna embraces it. He sees the divine energy even in the procreative urge.
The energy of sex is the fundamental energy of life. When it flows downwards, outwards, it creates new bodies, new life in the world. When the same energy is turned upwards, inwards, it creates a new birth for the individual himself. It leads to enlightenment. Krishna is not a life-denying teacher. He is showing the path of transformation, not suppression. In the very energy that binds you, he shows you the key to your liberation.
And of all rulers, he is Yama, the lord of death. This is the other side of the coin. He is the life-giving force, and he is also the lord of death. Life and death are not two. They are two aspects of the same reality, two poles of the same energy. To see the divine in both is to go beyond all fear.
