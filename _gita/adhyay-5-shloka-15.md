### Osho’s Commentary
The Lord takes neither your sin nor your virtue. He is not a celestial bookkeeper. He is pure existence, utterly indifferent to your moral calculations.
Then why are beings deluded? Ajnunenavritam jnanam—knowledge is covered by ignorance. This is the whole problem. Your own inner light is veiled by your own ignorance. And out of this ignorance, you think, “I am the doer,” and you create the whole drama of sin and virtue, of reward and punishment.
This is Maya, this is the illusion. It is a self-hypnosis. You are trapped in a dream of your own making. The moment the light of knowledge dawns, this veil of ignorance is burned away, and you see that there was never any sinner and never any saint—only the pure, untainted consciousness of the divine.
