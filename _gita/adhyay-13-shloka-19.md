### Osho’s Commentary
Both nature and spirit, Prakriti and Purusha, are beginningless, anadi. This is a very profound statement. It means that existence is not a creation in time. It has always been. The duality of matter and consciousness is eternal.
And all modifications, all qualities, are born of Prakriti. All the changes, all the play of the world, happens in the realm of nature. The Purusha, the spirit, is just a silent witness. It is never modified, never touched by the play.
To understand this is to find a deep sense of peace. You realize that your true nature is the unchanging witness, and all the turmoil of life is just a passing show in the field of nature.
