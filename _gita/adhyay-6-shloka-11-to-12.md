### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now gives some practical instructions. To the modern mind, these may seem strange. A clean spot, a seat of a certain height, made of grass, deerskin, and cloth. What has this to do with the soul?
These are subtle sciences. The earth has its own gravitational pull, its own energies. An insulated seat—made of materials like kusha grass or wool which are non-conductors of electricity—helps the seeker to conserve his own inner energy. It prevents the energy from being dissipated into the earth.
The place should be neither too high nor too low. In a deep valley, you will be affected by lower, denser vibrations. On a high mountaintop, if you are not ready, the purer vibrations can be too much for you. One must begin from where one is.
And on this seat, one makes the mind one-pointed and practices yoga for self-purification. These outer arrangements are just skillful means to create the right atmosphere for the inner journey. They are not the goal, but they can be helpful supports on the way.
