### Osho’s Commentary
He who, free from all delusion, knows me as this Supreme Person, he becomes a knower of all. And he worships me with his whole being.
When you have known the totality, you have known everything worth knowing. And your life becomes a total act of worship, a sarva-bhavena, an offering of your entire being.
This, says Krishna, is the most secret science, guhyatamam shastram. And knowing this, a man becomes truly wise, and he becomes krita-krityah—one who has done all that was to be done.
This is the state of ultimate fulfillment. The journey is over. The seeking is finished. There is nothing more to achieve, nothing more to become. You have arrived home. You have realized your own supreme nature. This is the final and most glorious promise of the Gita.
