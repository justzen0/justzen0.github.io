### Osho’s Commentary
What is night for the worldly man—the inner world of the Self—is broad daylight for the sage. And what is daylight for the worldly man—the outer world of sense-objects—is dark night for the sage.
Their worlds are completely reversed. They live in two different dimensions of reality.
Just as the ocean remains unmoved, though the waters of all rivers enter into it, so too, the sage in whom all desires enter finds peace—not the desirer of desires.
He who abandons all desires and acts free from longing, without the sense of "I" and "mine"—he attains to peace.
This, O Partha, is the Brahmi state. Having attained it, one is not deluded. Being established in it even at the hour of death, one attains the bliss of Brahman. This is the ultimate goal, the final resting in one’s own true nature.












Of course. Here is the third chapter of Gita Darshan, with each shloka and its commentary summarized in the voice of Osho.
