### Osho’s Commentary
"Seeing my own people, O Krishna, my limbs grow weak, my mouth dries up, my body trembles, and my hair stands on end. The Gandiva bow slips from my hand."
This is not the language of a coward. This is the language of a man whose heart is breaking. The sorrow is not just a thought in his mind; it is a deep, physical phenomenon. His whole body is responding to the agony of his soul.
The problem is not that he has to fight. The problem is that he has to fight his own people. The very foundation of his life is his connection to his family, his clan. And this war is asking him to destroy that very foundation.
His sorrow is born of mamatva, the sense of "mine." This is my grandfather, this is my teacher. This sense of "mine" is the root of all violence. But for Arjuna, it has become the root of his compassion. He is a violent man, a warrior, but his violence is limited by his love for his own people. When his violence is asked to turn upon his own, his whole being rebels. He is a good man, but his goodness is limited. And it is this very limitation that has brought him to this crisis.
