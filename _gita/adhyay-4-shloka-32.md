### Osho’s Commentary
All these varied forms of sacrifice, says Krishna, have come from the mouth of Brahman, from the divine itself. The paths are many, but the source is one.
And know them all to be born of action, karmajan. This is a crucial point. Even the highest spiritual discipline is a form of action. Do not get caught in the illusion of escaping action. The way is through action, but an action that is purified, that is transformed into a sacrifice.
Knowing this, you will be liberated. Knowing what? Knowing that every path, every action, if performed with the spirit of sacrifice, can lead to freedom. You don't have to seek a special path. You can transform your very life, right where you are, into a sacred yajna. This knowledge is freedom.
