> Since, by truly seeing God, who is present everywhere alike, he does not injure the Self by the Self, he therefore attains the supreme Goal.

### Osho’s Commentary
He truly sees who sees that all actions are performed by nature alone, and that the Self is akartaram, the non-doer.
This is the essence of Karma Yoga. The body, the mind, the senses—these are all part of nature, and they act according to their inherent qualities. The Self is just a pure witness. It does nothing.
When you have this vision, you are freed from the burden of doership. You are no longer proud of your good deeds, nor are you guilty of your bad deeds. You become a detached observer of the play of nature. And in that detachment is ultimate freedom.
