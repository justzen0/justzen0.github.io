### Osho’s Commentary
For those who offer all their actions to me, who are singularly devoted to me—for them, I become the savior.
The path of devotion is a path of surrender. It is a letting go. The path of knowledge is a struggle; you have to do everything yourself. In the path of love, you have to do only one thing: surrender. And then, the grace of the divine takes over.
It is like two people trying to cross a river. The man of knowledge is a great swimmer. He struggles against the current, using his own strength. He may or may not reach the other shore. But the devotee is like a small child, who simply holds the hand of his father. He does not swim; he is carried across.
Krishna says, “For those whose minds are absorbed in me, I soon lift them out of this ocean of death and worldly existence.” The emphasis is on soon. In the path of knowledge, the journey can be long, arduous, spanning many lives. But in the path of love, the transformation can be instantaneous. The moment the surrender is total, the grace descends.
