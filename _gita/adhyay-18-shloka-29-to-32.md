### Osho’s Commentary
Now listen, my friend, to the three kinds of intellect, the three kinds of buddhi.
The sattvic intellect is one of pure, clear discrimination. It knows what is action and what is renunciation. It knows what is to be done and what is not to be done. It knows the difference between fear and fearlessness, between bondage and liberation. It is a clear, unwavering light.
The rajasic intellect is confused. It does not see things clearly. It mistakes wrong for right and right for wrong. It is a clouded, wavering intelligence.
And the tamasic intellect is enveloped in darkness. It sees everything in a perverted way. It calls darkness light and light darkness. It calls poison nectar and nectar poison. It is a state of utter delusion.
Your intellect is the faculty that can lead you to liberation. But if it is clouded by rajas or shrouded in the darkness of tamas, it will only lead you deeper into bondage. To purify the intellect, to make it sattvic, is one of the greatest steps on the spiritual path.
