### Osho’s Commentary
Just as a tortoise withdraws its limbs into its shell for protection, so too, the man of steady wisdom can withdraw his senses from the world.
This is not a physical act of closing the eyes and ears. It is a withdrawal of the inner energy, the attention, from the outer world. The senses are the doorways through which our life force flows out. The yogi learns the art of turning this flow inwards.
Even for one who abstains from food, the taste for it remains. But even this taste departs when the supreme is seen.
The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, forcibly carry away the mind even of a wise man who is striving.
Having restrained them all, he should sit steadfast, intent on me. For he whose senses are under control, his wisdom is firmly set.
