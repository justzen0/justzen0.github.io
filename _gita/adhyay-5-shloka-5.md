### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna emphasizes the point again, with the clarity of a polished diamond. The destination reached by the men of knowledge is the same as that reached by the men of action.
We see the world through the interpretation of our own minds. We see difference where there is none. We see contradiction where there is only a deeper harmony. Our vision is colored by our own prejudices.
The one who truly sees, sah pashyati, is the one who can see the underlying unity. He sees the renouncer sitting in his cave and the Karma Yogi acting in the world, and he knows that if their hearts are pure, if their consciousness is clear, they are walking towards the same ocean. The paths on the surface may seem to diverge, but in the depths, they are one. To see this oneness is the true vision.
