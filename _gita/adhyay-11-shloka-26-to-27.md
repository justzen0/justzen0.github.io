> And into You enter all those sons of Dhrtarastra, along with multitudes of the rulers of the earth, Bhisma, Drona, and that son of a Suta, Karna, together with our prominent warriors.<br><br>They rapidly enter into Your terrible mouths with cruel teeth! Some are seen sticking in the gaps between the teeth, with their heads crushed!

### Osho’s Commentary
Now the vision becomes very specific. Arjuna sees all the warriors on both sides—his enemies and his own comrades—rushing into those terrifying mouths. He sees them being crushed between the teeth of God.
This is the vision of destiny, of a reality that is already predetermined. The battle has not yet been fought, but Arjuna is seeing its outcome. He is seeing that all these great warriors are already dead, already consumed by time.
This vision dissolves the illusion of free will. It shows that our individual actions are just small movements within a vast, cosmic drama whose script has already been written.
