> As the all-pervading space is not defiled, due to its subtlety, similarly the Self, present everywhere in bodies, is not defiled.

### Osho’s Commentary
Just as the one sun illumines the whole world, so too the knower of the field illumines the entire field.
The Self is like the sun. The field—the body, the mind, the world—is dark in itself. It is the light of the Self, the light of consciousness, that makes it known.
Without this inner sun of awareness, you would live in a world of total darkness, of unconsciousness. To turn your attention towards this inner sun, to become aware of the source of all light—this is the whole purpose of meditation.
