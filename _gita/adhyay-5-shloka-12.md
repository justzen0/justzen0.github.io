> Giving up the results of work by becoming resolute in faith, one attains peace arising from steadfastness. One who is lacking in resolute faith, being attached to the results under the impulse of desire, becomes bound.

### Osho’s Commentary
A clear distinction is made between the man of yoga and the man without yoga.
The yogi, the yukta, abandons the fruit of his action. By letting go of the result, he attains shantim naishthikim, a peace that is unshakable, established, eternal. His peace is not dependent on the outcome of his actions. It is a peace that is intrinsic to the very act of letting go.
The non-yogi, the ayukta, acts out of desire, kamakarena, and is attached to the fruit. And because of this attachment, he is bound, nibadhyate. His peace is always conditional. If he succeeds, he is happy for a moment. If he fails, he is miserable. He is a slave to the results, a puppet whose strings are pulled by success and failure. His life is a constant fever of anxiety and expectation. The yogi has stepped out of this feverish dream into the cool reality of peace.
