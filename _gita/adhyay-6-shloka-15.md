> Concentrating the mind thus, forever, the yogi of a controlled mind achieves the peace that culminates in liberation and abides in Me.

### Osho’s Commentary
Thus, the yogi who constantly keeps his self in tune, attains the ultimate peace, the peace that is established in Me, which is Nirvana itself.
This peace is not an ordinary peace. It is not the absence of conflict. It is a positive, overflowing bliss. It is the very nature of the divine.
And this peace culminates in Nirvana. Nirvana means the cessation of the ego, the blowing out of the candle of the small self. When the “I” disappears, what remains is the boundless, eternal ocean of bliss. This is the ultimate goal. The journey of the yogi is a journey from the noisy marketplace of the mind to this profound, silent peace of the divine.
