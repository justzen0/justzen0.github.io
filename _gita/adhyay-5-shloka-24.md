> One who is content within, whose pleasure is within, and whose light is only within, that yogi, having become Brahman, attains absorption into Brahman.

### Osho’s Commentary
The journey is from the outside to the inside. The yogi is one whose search has turned completely inwards.
His happiness is within, antah-sukho. His delight is within, antar-aramas. His light is within, antar-jyotir.
He no longer seeks joy, comfort, or truth in the outer world. He has found the kingdom of God within himself. And such a yogi, having become one with Brahman, attains brahma-nirvanam, the ultimate liberation, the supreme bliss that is the nature of the divine itself.
