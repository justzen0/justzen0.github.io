### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now reveals the hierarchy of consciousness within man. This is a map for the inner journey.
The senses are superior to the physical body. They are subtler, more powerful.
Superior to the senses is the mind. The mind can control the senses.
Superior to the mind is the intellect, the buddhi. The intellect can bring clarity and discrimination to the chaotic world of the mind.
And superior even to the intellect is Sah, He, the ultimate Self, the Atman.
This is the ladder of consciousness. We are living at the lowest rung, identified with the body and the senses. The spiritual journey is a journey upwards, from the gross to the subtle.
From the senses to the mind. From the mind to the intellect. And from the intellect, one has to take a final leap into the Self. This final leap is not a step, but a dissolution. The intellect has to be surrendered.
The path is from the periphery to the center. The senses are the outermost periphery. The Self is the innermost core. The one who travels this inner path finds his true home.
