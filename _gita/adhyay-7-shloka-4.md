### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna divides his nature, prakriti, into eight parts. He begins with the five great elements: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. But this is not a lesson in physics; it is a map of inner reality.
These are not just outer elements; they are symbols for the states of matter, the states of energy.
Agni, fire, is the fundamental element. It is the life-energy, the cosmic electricity that is the basis of all.
Earth is fire in its solid state. Water is fire in its liquid state. Air is fire in its gaseous state.
And akasha, ether, is the space in which this whole play of energy happens.
Then he moves inward, to the three subtler elements: mind (manas), intellect (buddhi), and ego (ahankara).
Mind is the capacity for thought, for consciousness—even animals have it. Intellect is the capacity for reason, for logic, for discrimination. It is a more refined state of mind. And ego is the subtlest of all. It is the deep-rooted feeling of “I am.” It is the last and most difficult barrier.
Krishna says, “These eight constitute my lower nature.” He is giving Arjuna a map. He is saying, “Understand this territory, for only by understanding it can you go beyond it.”
