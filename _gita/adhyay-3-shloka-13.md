### Osho’s Commentary
What are these “remnants of sacrifice”? The literal meaning is what is left over after a ritual offering. But Krishna’s meaning is much deeper, much more existential.
The one who lives a life of Yajna lives for others first. He shares what he has—be it food, love, or wisdom. And only what remains after sharing, he accepts for himself. He is a santa, a righteous one, a saint. He is free from all sin. Why? Because sin is born of the ego, and his life is a process of dissolving the ego through sharing.
And the one who lives only for himself? The one who cooks only for his own sake? Krishna uses a very strong word. He says such a person eats only sin, agham. His very food becomes poison.
This is a profound psychological law. The more you are obsessed with yourself, the more miserable you become. The self is a prison. The moment you start thinking of others, sharing with others, a window opens, and fresh air comes in. The person who gives receives a joy that the person who takes can never know.
The poor man is not one who has little, but one who cannot give. The rich man is one who has the capacity to share. The whole of life is a feast. The sinner is one who eats alone, hiding his food from others. The saint is one who invites everyone to the feast and eats only when everyone else has eaten. His life becomes a celebration, a source of nourishment for all.
