### Osho’s Commentary
Who is the one who finds this knowledge? Krishna describes three qualities.
He is shraddhavan, a man of faith. This is not blind belief. Shraddha is an innocent trust, an openness to existence. It is the heart of a child, not the calculating mind of a scholar.
He is tatparah, devoted to it. He has a single-pointed passion for truth. It is his only love, his only seeking.
He is samyatendriyah, one who has mastered his senses. His energies are not dissipated in the outer world. They are conserved and channeled inwards.
When these three qualities—trust, passion, and self-mastery—come together in a person, he attains knowledge. And having attained knowledge, he immediately, achirena, without any delay, attains the supreme peace, param shantim. Peace is not something you achieve after knowledge; it is the very fragrance of knowing.
