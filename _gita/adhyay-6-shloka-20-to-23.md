> At the time when the mind, restrained through the practice of Yoga, is withdrawn, and just when one sees the Self by the self and remains contented in the Self alone;<br><br>When one experiences that absolute Bliss, which can be intuited by the intellect and which is beyond the senses, and being thus established, this person surely does not swerve from Reality.<br><br>Obtaining which one does not consider any other acquisition to be superior, and being established in which one is not perturbed even by great sorrow;<br><br>One should know that severance of contact with sorrow to be what is called Yoga. That Yoga should be practiced with perseverance and with an undepressed heart.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now describes the supreme state, the state of samadhi.
It is a state where the mind, quieted by the practice of yoga, finds its rest.
In this state, seeing the Self by the Self, one is satisfied in the Self alone.
He finds that infinite happiness which is beyond the senses, which can be grasped only by the purified intellect. Established there, he never moves from the reality.
Having gained this, he thinks there is no greater gain. And established in this, he is not shaken even by the heaviest sorrow.
This is the state of yoga—a dis-connection from the union with pain.
This is the ultimate promise of yoga. To go beyond all sorrow, to find a bliss that is eternal, uncaused, and unshakable. This is not a pleasure that comes from the outside; it is the very fragrance of your own being. When you have tasted this, you have tasted the divine. You have come home.
