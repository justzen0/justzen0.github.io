### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna’s list of glories continues, each one a profound symbol.
Of the demons, he is Prahlada. Even in the house of a demon, a great devotee can be born. This is a message of ultimate hope. No circumstance can be a barrier to one who has a deep thirst for the divine.
Of the purifiers, I am the wind. The wind is constantly moving, never stagnant. It represents a consciousness that is always flowing, always fresh, never clinging to the past. This constant flow is the very nature of purity.
Of those who wield weapons, I am Rama. Rama represents the ideal man, the man of dharma, who wields power but is not corrupted by it, who fights for righteousness but remains a man of love and compassion.
Of all sciences, I am the science of the Self, adhyatma-vidya. All other sciences are concerned with the outer world. This is the one science that leads you to the knowledge of your own innermost being. It is the supreme science.
Of all letters, I am the letter ‘A’. In Sanskrit, ‘A’ is the first and most fundamental sound, from which all other sounds emerge.
And finally, I am the inexhaustible time. Time is the one reality that is ever-flowing, that never ends. Everything else changes, but time remains.
These are all pointers, my friend. Pointers to a reality that is beyond all words, beyond all symbols. They are invitations to look deeper, to see the divine presence in all its myriad forms.
