> Arjuna said, "Now then, O scion of the Vrsni dynasty (Krsna), what compels this man to commit sin even against his will, as if he were constrained by force?"

### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna asks a question that has haunted humanity for ages. Why does man commit sin, even when he doesn't want to? It feels as if some force, baladiva, is compelling him against his will.
This is the experience of every man. We know what is right, but we do what is wrong. We make resolutions, and we break them. It seems we are not masters in our own house. Some dark force seems to take possession of us.
Religions have called this force Satan, the devil. They have created a mythology around it. But Krishna gives a psychological, a scientific answer. He does not bring in any external entity. He points to a force within man himself.
