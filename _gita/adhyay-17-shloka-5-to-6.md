> Those persons who, given to ostentation and pride, and possessed of passion, attachment, and strength, undertake severe austerities not sanctioned by the scriptures;<br><br>(And those who,) being non-discriminating, torture all the organs in the body as well as even Me who reside in the body—know them to be possessed of demoniacal conviction.
