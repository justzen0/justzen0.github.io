> Self-conceited, haughty, filled with pride and intoxicated by wealth, they perform sacrifices that are only in name, ostentatiously and without regard for the injunctions.<br><br>Resorting to egotism, power, arrogance, passion, and anger, hating Me in their own and others' bodies, they become envious by nature.

### Osho’s Commentary
They are self-conceited, stubborn, intoxicated with the pride of wealth. Even their sacrifices are just for show, full of hypocrisy.
And given over to ego, power, lust, and anger, these malicious people hate me—the divine—in their own bodies and in the bodies of others.
This is a very profound statement. The divine is present in every heart. When you hate another, you are hating the divine that dwells within them. And when you live a life of ego and desire, you are hating the divine that is your own innermost core. The atheist is not one who denies God; he is one who lives in a way that is a constant denial of the divine presence within and without.
