### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna gives the method. First, abandon all desires born of the egoic will, completely. And restrain the senses with the mind.
Then, slowly, slowly, shanaih shanaih, withdraw. This is a very important secret. The journey inwards is not a sudden jump for most people. It is a gradual withdrawal, a patient process.
With the intellect held in firmness, establish the mind in the Self. And then, na kinchidapi chintayet—do not think of anything.
This is the ultimate key: to arrive at a state of no-thought. Thoughts are the clouds that hide the inner sun. When the mind is completely established in the Self, all thoughts cease. In that thoughtless awareness, in that pure silence, the ultimate reality is revealed.
