### Osho’s Commentary
And here is the key that opens the door. Arjuna does not demand. He is not arrogant. He says, “If you think it is possible for me to see…”
He is utterly aware of his own limitations. He knows that his desire to see is one thing, but his capacity to see is another. He leaves the decision in the hands of the master. This is true surrender.
The ego demands, “Show me!” It thinks it has a right to the truth. But the truth cannot be demanded; it can only be received in deep humility. Arjuna’s prayer is not a claim; it is a question filled with surrender. “Am I worthy, Krishna? Is it possible for these small eyes to behold your vastness?”
When a disciple reaches this point of total trust, where he leaves even the ultimate decision to the master, the master can do nothing but open the final door. This humility, this awareness of one’s own nothingness, is the final qualification.
