### Osho’s Commentary
Who is this wise man, this pandit? He is one whose actions are free from kama and sankalpa—from desire and the will that is born of desire.
Our actions are always motivated. We act to get something, to achieve something. This motive, this desire, is the seed of bondage. The wise man acts without any such seed. His actions are not born of the wanting mind.
His past karmas have been burned in the fire of knowledge, jnanagni dagdha karmanam. Knowledge is a fire. It does not just inform you; it transforms you. It burns all the accumulated seeds of past actions, so they can no longer sprout. He is free from the past, and he is not creating any new bondage for the future. His action is pure, spontaneous, arising in the moment, for the moment. This, say the wise, is the mark of a true sage.
