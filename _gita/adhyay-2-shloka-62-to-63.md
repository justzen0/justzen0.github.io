From attachment grows hankering, and from hankering springs anger.<br><br>From anger follows delusion; from delusion, a failure of memory; from the failure of memory, the loss of understanding; and from the loss of understanding, one perishes.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now describes the downward spiral of the unenlightened mind.
It begins with a simple thought of a sense-object. From that thought, attachment is born. From attachment comes desire. When desire is obstructed, anger arises. From anger comes delusion, a clouding of the mind. From delusion comes the loss of memory—not just of worldly things, but of your own true Self. From the loss of this memory comes the destruction of the intellect, of your power of discrimination. And when discrimination is lost, the man is utterly lost.
This is a profound psychological map of the path to self-destruction. It all begins with a single, un-witnessed thought.
