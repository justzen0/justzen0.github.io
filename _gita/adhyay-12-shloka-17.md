> He who does not rejoice, nor fret, nor lament, nor hanker; who gives up both good and bad, and is filled with devotion—he is dear to Me.

### Osho’s Commentary
He neither rejoices in pleasure nor hates in pain. He does not grieve for what is lost, nor does he desire what he does not have.
He has renounced both good and evil. This is a profound state. We are all caught in the trap of morality, of good and bad. But the devotee has gone beyond this duality. He sees the divine hand in everything. For him, there is no good or bad, only the play of the divine.
He does not judge. He simply accepts. His heart is free from all the turmoil of the opposites. Such a one, full of devotion, is dear to me.
