### Osho’s Commentary
A tremendously hopeful message. Even if you are the greatest of all sinners, says Krishna, the boat of knowledge can carry you across the ocean of sin.
Sin is not a positive entity. It is simply darkness, ignorance. It has no substance of its own. You don't have to fight it. You simply have to bring in the light of knowledge. A single lamp can dispel the darkness of a thousand years. A single moment of awakening can burn away the sins of a million lifetimes.
Knowledge is a fire, jnanagnih. It reduces all karmas, all actions, past and present, to ashes. They can no longer create any bondage for you. They lose their power to create a future. The fire of knowing purifies you completely, leaving you utterly innocent, as if you were just born this very moment.
