### Osho’s Commentary
Here, Krishna defines the true renouncer, the nitya-sannyasi. He is not one who has physically run away from the world. He is one who neither hates (dveshti) nor desires (kankshati).
Life is a play of dualities—attraction and repulsion, love and hate. The mind is constantly swinging between these two poles. You are drawn towards something, or you are pushed away. But the one who stands still in the middle, the one who is a silent witness to this play of opposites, he is the true sannyasin.
He is nirdvandvo, free from the dualities. And for such a man, says Krishna, liberation from bondage comes easily, happily.
The real bondage is not outside; it is this inner turmoil of likes and dislikes. To drop this inner fever is the true renunciation. You may be sitting in the marketplace, but if you are free from this inner push and pull, you are a sannyasin. You may be sitting in a Himalayan cave, but if your mind is still oscillating between desire and aversion, you are a worldly man. The real geography is within.
