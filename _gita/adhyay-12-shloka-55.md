### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna concludes with a beautiful summary of the path. The one who comes to me is one who has five qualities:
He does all actions for my sake. His life is an offering.
He regards me as the supreme goal.
He is my devotee, filled with love.
He is free from all attachment.
And he is without enmity towards any being. His heart is filled with universal love.
When these five streams meet—selfless action, supreme goal, devotion, detachment, and universal love—the river of the individual soul merges with the ocean of the divine. This is the culmination of the spiritual journey. This is the ultimate fulfillment of human life.
















Of course. Here is the twelfth chapter of Gita Darshan, with each shloka and its commentary summarized in the voice of Osho.
