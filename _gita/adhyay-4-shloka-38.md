### Osho’s Commentary
There is no purifier like knowledge. All other methods of purification are external. They can only wash the surface. Knowledge purifies you from the very core of your being.
And this knowledge is not something to be found in books or scriptures. He who is perfected in yoga—who has balanced his being, who has stilled his mind—tat svayam…atmani vindati, finds it within himself. It is a spontaneous flowering.
It comes kalena, in due course of time. It cannot be forced. You just have to prepare the soil, create the right conditions of inner harmony and balance. And when the time is ripe, when the season is right, the seed of divinity within you sprouts on its own. It is a revelation from within.
