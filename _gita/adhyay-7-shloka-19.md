### Osho’s Commentary
This realization does not come easily. It comes at the end of many, many births. After long wandering, after many mistakes, after much suffering, a man finally awakens to this ultimate wisdom.
And what is that wisdom? Vasudevah sarvam iti—“Vasudeva is all.” The divine is everything. There is nothing but the divine.
The one who realizes this, says Krishna, is a mahatma, a great soul. And such a great soul is very rare. Why? Because it requires a total death of the ego. To see God in everything means there is no room left for your own separate self.
This is the peak of realization. The world of separation vanishes, and a new world of unity is revealed. The sinner and the saint, the flower and the thorn, the light and the darkness—all are seen as different faces of the one divine reality. To live in this vision is to live in constant bliss.
