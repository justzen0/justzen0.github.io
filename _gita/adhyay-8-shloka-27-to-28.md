### Osho’s Commentary
The yogi who knows these two paths is never deluded. He knows the map of consciousness. He knows which way leads to freedom and which to bondage. And so, Krishna urges Arjuna, "Therefore, at all times, be steadfast in yoga." Be constantly aware, constantly balanced between the opposites.
And the final, glorious conclusion: the yogi who knows this supreme secret goes beyond all the fruits of so-called good deeds. The rewards promised in scriptures, sacrifices, austerities, and charity—these are all part of the lower path, the path of return.
The true yogi is not interested in these heavenly pleasures. He transcends them all. He is not seeking a reward; he is seeking the ultimate reality itself. And knowing this, he attains the supreme, ancient, original home from which he came. He does not just attain a result; he becomes one with the source of all. This is the ultimate victory.
