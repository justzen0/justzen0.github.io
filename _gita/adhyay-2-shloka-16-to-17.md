### Osho’s Commentary
That which is unreal, the asat, has no true existence. It is like a dream. And that which is real, the sat, can never cease to exist.
This is a fundamental law. The unreal is the world of forms, of names, of appearances. It is constantly changing, coming and going. The real is the formless, nameless, underlying reality—the pure consciousness that pervades everything.
This consciousness is indestructible. No sword can cut it, no fire can burn it. It is the eternal, unchanging ground of all existence. To know this is to be free from all fear.
