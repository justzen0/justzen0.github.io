### Osho’s Commentary
Sanjaya says Arjuna is filled with pity, his eyes overflowing with tears. But listen, my friend, is it pity? Or is it something else?
There is daya, which you call pity, and there is karuna, which is compassion. They are worlds apart. Pity is a sickness. It is situational. You see a beggar, and a feeling arises in you—not for the beggar, but for your own ego. In that moment of giving a coin, the ego feels nourished, superior. Pity is a beautiful disguise for the ego.
Compassion is a fragrance of the soul. It has no cause, no situation. A flower blooms in a solitary forest, its fragrance spreading with no one to receive it. So is compassion. A Buddha is compassionate, not because you are miserable, but because he is an overflowing of bliss. Compassion liberates; pity binds.
Arjuna is not filled with compassion. He is drowning in pity. And this pity is a beautiful disguise for his ego. He thinks, "How can I, such a great man, do this terrible deed? It is better that they kill me." The focus is on the "I," on his self-image.
And Krishna, the master psychologist, sees this immediately. His first words are not of solace; they are a hammer blow. He calls Arjuna’s state "un-Aryan," an "impurity," an "impotence." He is not trying to console a sick man; he is trying to shock him out of his sickness. He attacks the ego directly, for the ego is the root of the disease. He is not a sympathizer; he is a surgeon with a knife. He must cut through the layers of self-deception to reach the real wound.
