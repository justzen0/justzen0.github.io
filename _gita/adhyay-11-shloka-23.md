> O Mighty-Armed One, seeing Your immense form with many mouths, eyes, arms, thighs, feet, bellies, and teeth, the creatures are struck with terror, and so am I.

### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna now openly admits his own terror. "Seeing your great form, with its many mouths, eyes, and terrible tusks, the worlds are terrified, and so am I."
The initial wonder and delight have now given way to a profound fear. He is seeing the destructive aspect of the divine, the face of the devourer.
All our ideas of God are comforting. We create gods in our own image, gods who will protect us. But the real God is not just a protector; he is also the destroyer. He is the totality of existence, which includes both life and death, beauty and terror. To see this totality is to have all your childish securities shattered.
