### Osho’s Commentary
This is the final culmination of the chapter. Krishna gives the ultimate technique.
“Knowing Him who is superior to the intellect…” First, know your own ultimate reality, the Self. This is not an intellectual knowing, but a direct experience, a realization.
“…steadying the self by the Self.” The lower self, the mind, has to be controlled and steadied by the higher Self, the pure consciousness. It is like using a diamond to cut another diamond. Only the power of the Self can master the mind.
And when you are established in this inner knowing, when your mind is stilled by the power of your own consciousness, then, says Krishna, “Slay the enemy in the form of desire,”—kamarupam durasadam, which is so difficult to conquer.
When you are fighting from the level of the mind, you cannot win against desire, because desire is also a part of the mind. But when you move to the center of your being, to the Self, you are no longer on the same plane as desire. You are watching it from a higher peak. And from that height of awareness, desire simply dissolves. It has no power over you.
This is the ultimate alchemy: to use the power of the Self to transform the energy of desire. This is the victory that makes a man a true master of himself.




















Of course. Here is the fourth chapter of Gita Darshan, with each shloka and its commentary summarized in the voice of Osho.
