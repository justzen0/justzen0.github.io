### Osho’s Commentary
This Supreme Self is beginningless and without qualities. Therefore, though it dwells in the body, it neither acts nor is it tainted.
The body acts, the mind thinks, but the Self remains a pure, untouched witness. It is like the space in a pot. The pot may be filled with pure water or with dirty water, but the space within remains untouched, unstained.
So too, the Self dwells in the body, but it is not affected by the actions of the body, whether good or bad. To realize this unstainable, actionless nature of your own being is liberation.
