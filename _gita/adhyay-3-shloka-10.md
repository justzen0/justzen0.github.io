### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna is now revealing a cosmic secret. He says that creation itself is a Yajna, a sacrifice. When the creator, Prajapati, brought forth life, he did so not out of any selfish motive, but out of a sheer explosion of joy, a spontaneous flowering.
The universe is not a product of desire. It is a manifestation of bliss. A seed breaks open and becomes a sprout. The sprout breaks open and becomes a great tree. The tree bursts forth into a million flowers. This is the nature of existence: to overflow, to share, to celebrate.
Man, too, is created with this innate nature of sacrifice. The divine says, “Through this sacrifice, you shall prosper. This shall be your kamadhuk,” your wish-fulfilling cow. Whatever you desire will be yours, if your life becomes an offering.
We think of the creator as someone who made the world and then retired. This is not the Eastern vision. For us, the creator is creativity itself. The creation is happening this very moment. The divine is constantly flowing, constantly creating. We have just become disconnected from that source because of our ego. We think, “I am the doer.”
The moment this illusion of “I” drops, you become part of the great cosmic Yajna. Then you see the hands of God in your hands, the eyes of God in your eyes, the breath of God in your breath. You become a participant in the divine celebration. And in that participation is all fulfillment, all prosperity, all bliss.
