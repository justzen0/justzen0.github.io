### Osho’s Commentary
Of all trees, Krishna says, I am the Ashvattha, the sacred fig tree. The peepal tree is held in special reverence in India, not just for its mythological associations, but because, even scientifically, it is unique. It is the one tree that releases oxygen twenty-four hours a day. It is a source of life-giving energy.
Of the divine sages, he chooses Narada. Narada is a unique figure. He is not a grave, serious ascetic. He is a playful, joyful being, a musician who wanders through all the worlds, singing the praises of the divine. He represents a religion that is not a burden, but a celebration.
Of the perfected beings, he chooses Kapila, the founder of the Sankhya philosophy. Sankhya is a path of pure knowledge, of discrimination. It teaches that liberation comes not by doing anything, but by simply knowing, by realizing your true nature as the pure, witnessing consciousness.
Krishna is pointing to different paths, different qualities—the life-giving energy of the peepal tree, the joyful playfulness of Narada, the pure wisdom of Kapila. He is saying that in all these highest manifestations, you can find a glimpse of me.
