> But that man who rejoices only in the Self, is satisfied with the Self, and is content only in the Self—for him there is no duty to perform.

### Osho’s Commentary
Now comes the ultimate state. Krishna has spoken of flowing with the wheel of life. But there is a point when one goes even beyond the wheel.
Who is this man? He is one who finds his joy not in the outer world, not in the senses, but in his own innermost being, the Atman, the Self. He is atmarati, one who rejoices in the Self. He is atmatripta, one who is fulfilled by the Self. He is atmanyeva santushta, one who is content only in the Self.
For such a man, there is no karyam, no action that needs to be done. He has arrived. He has reached the center of the wheel. The wheel continues to turn, but he is at the still point.
This is the state of the enlightened one, the Buddha, the Christ. Action may continue to happen through him, but he is not the doer. There is no motive, no desire, no goal to be achieved. His actions are like the fragrance of a flower—they simply are. They happen out of his overflowing bliss, not out of any sense of duty.
For him, there is no need to follow any prescribed rules or social norms. He has gone beyond all divisions, all disciplines. He himself has become the law. His very being is a blessing to the world.
