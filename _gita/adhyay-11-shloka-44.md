> Therefore, by bowing down and prostrating my body, I seek to propitiate You who are God and are adorable. O Lord, You should forgive my faults as a father would forgive the faults of a son, as a friend would forgive the faults of a friend, and as a lover would forgive the faults of a beloved.

### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna prostrates himself and begs for grace. He asks for forgiveness, using the most intimate human relationships as examples. Forgive me as a father forgives a son, as a friend forgives a friend, as a lover forgives the beloved.
He is asking for a return to intimacy, but a new kind of intimacy. Not the intimacy of equals, but the intimacy of a soul that has completely surrendered to the divine.
He is asking the infinite to relate to him in a finite, human way. This is the prayer of the devotee. He does not want to lose the personal relationship with God. He wants the formless to have a form, the impersonal to have a personal face, so that a relationship of love is possible.
