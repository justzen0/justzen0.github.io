### Osho’s Commentary
The whole world is hypnotized, mohitam, by the play of these three qualities. And in this hypnosis, it does not recognize Me, who is beyond them.
The sinner is deluded by tamas. The ambitious man is deluded by rajas. And even the virtuous man, the man of sattva, is deluded. His virtue, if it is without a connection to the divine, is just a polished ego. It is a beautiful chain, a golden chain, but a chain nonetheless.
Whether you are a sinner or a saint, as long as you are playing within the field of these three qualities, you are asleep. You are lost in the dream of the world. The only way out is to become a witness to this play. To see the sattva rising, the rajas rising, the tamas rising, and to know that you are none of these. You are the pure consciousness that watches them all. To go beyond good and evil is the beginning of true religion. To go beyond all the qualities of nature is to find the divine.
