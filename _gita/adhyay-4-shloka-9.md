### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna speaks of his divine birth (janma divyam) and divine action (karma divyam). His birth is not ordinary; it is a play. His action is not ordinary; it is a happening. He who understands this in its essence—tattvatah, in its very truth—is liberated.
To know Krishna’s birth as divine is to realize that your own innermost being is also unborn. To know his action as divine is to realize that when you act without ego, your actions too become divine.
Krishna is a mirror. To look at him is to see your own ultimate potential. He is the fulfilled man, and you are the seed. In him, you see what you can become. The one who understands this, who sees not just the historical Krishna but the eternal principle he represents, is freed from the cycle of birth and death. He doesn't just go to a heaven; he comes to me, says Krishna. He merges with the divine source from which he has come.
