### Osho’s Commentary
For the one whose self is not in control, yoga is difficult to attain. This is my opinion, says Krishna. But for the one who has mastered his own self, who is striving, it is possible to attain through the right means.
The path is possible, but it requires effort. It requires a disciplined, self-controlled approach. It is not for the lazy, the half-hearted.
But Krishna uses the beautiful phrase, “This is my opinion.” He is not laying down a dogma. He is sharing his own experience. He is saying, “From what I have seen, this is the way.” This is the gentle, persuasive tone of a true master. He does not command; he only shows the way.
