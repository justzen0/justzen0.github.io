### Osho’s Commentary
The one who knows the Self as eternal and indestructible—how can such a person kill anyone, or cause anyone to be killed?
This is a very subtle point. Krishna is not saying that the wise man will not physically participate in an act of killing. He is saying that the wise man will have no sense of being the killer.
His action will be a pure, detached happening, without any egoistic involvement. The body may act, but the consciousness within remains a silent witness. For such a person, there is no sin, no karma, because the doer is absent.
