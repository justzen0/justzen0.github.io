> Arjuna said, "O God, I see in Your body all the gods, as well as hosts of various classes of beings; Brahma the ruler, sitting on a lotus seat, and all the heavenly sages and serpents.<br><br>I see You with numerous arms, bellies, mouths, and eyes; with infinite forms all around. O Lord of the Universe, O Cosmic Person, I see no limit, no middle, nor beginning!

### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna’s speech is now not that of a philosopher, but of a poet, a mystic, trying to describe the indescribable.
He sees all the gods, all beings, even Brahma, the creator, within that one form. He sees a form that is endless, with no beginning, middle, or end.
This is the experience of the infinite. Our minds are trained to see things with a beginning and an end. But the divine reality is beginningless and endless. To see this is to have your mind completely shattered.
And in that shattering, a new vision is born. A vision that is not linear, but holographic. Every part contains the whole. The universe is not just in Krishna; Krishna is in every particle of the universe. This is the great mystery.
