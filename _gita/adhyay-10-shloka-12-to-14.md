### Osho’s Commentary
On the surface, it seems Arjuna has accepted everything. He repeats all the highest praises. He says, “You are the Supreme Brahman, the eternal person.” And he brings in witnesses—Narada, Asita, Devala, Vyasa. He says, “All these great sages say so, and you yourself are saying so to me. Therefore, I believe it to be true.”
But look carefully. Is this true acceptance? Or is it an argument of the mind? He is still relying on witnesses. He is still standing outside. If the acceptance were total, the Gita would have ended here. But it does not.
Arjuna is convinced, but not transformed. He is intellectually persuaded, but not existentially moved. It is as if a man standing before the sun says, “Yes, I believe you are the sun, because the scriptures say so, and all the wise men say so.” But he has not opened his own eyes to see.
This is the state of the intellectual believer. His belief is borrowed. It is not a direct perception. And a belief that is borrowed can be shaken by the slightest doubt. Arjuna’s acceptance is conditional. It is based on the authority of others. It has not yet become his own truth. And as long as a truth is not your own, it is a lie.
