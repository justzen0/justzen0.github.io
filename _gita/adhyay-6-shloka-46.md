> A yogi is higher than those of austerity; they are considered higher even than those of knowledge. The yogi is also higher than those of action. Therefore, O Arjuna, become a yogi.

### Osho’s Commentary
The yogi is superior to all others. He is greater than the ascetic who merely tortures his body. He is greater than the scholar who merely accumulates knowledge from books. He is greater than the man of action who acts with ego and desire.
Why? Because the yogi is a balanced, integrated being. He is not one-sided. His path includes the essence of all other paths—the austerity of the ascetic, the wisdom of the scholar, and the action of the man of action—but all performed with a new consciousness, a new balance.
Therefore, says Krishna to Arjuna, “Be a yogi.” This is the supreme invitation.
