> As boyhood, youth, and decrepitude are to an embodied being in this present body, so is the acquisition of another body. Therefore, an intelligent person does not get deluded.

### Osho’s Commentary
Just as in this one body you pass from childhood to youth to old age, and you know that you are the same one who has passed through all these changes, so too, the soul passes from one body to another.
The body is a house. You live in it for a while, and when it becomes old and dilapidated, you leave it and find a new one. The wise man is not bewildered by this. He knows that he is not the house, but the dweller.
The fear of death is the fear of losing the form, the house. But when you realize your identity with the dweller, the fear disappears. You see death not as an end, but as a change of residence.
