> That sacrifice which is in accordance with the injunctions, performed by persons who do not hanker after results, and with the mental conviction that it is surely obligatory, is done through sattva.

### Osho’s Commentary
The sattvic sacrifice is that which is done without any desire for the fruit. It is done simply because it is one’s duty, one’s dharma. The mind is fixed on the act itself, not on any future reward.
This is the state of desireless action. It is an action that is a pure joy in itself. When you act in this way, you are freed from the bondage of karma. The action leaves no trace, no residue. It is like writing on water. To act with this quality of pure, motiveless joy is to live in a state of constant freedom.
