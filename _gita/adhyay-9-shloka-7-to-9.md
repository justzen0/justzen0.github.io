### Osho’s Commentary
The Hindu vision of time is not a straight line, but a vast circle. There is a cosmic day and a cosmic night. A kalpa is one day of Brahma, a vast period of billions of years. At the dawn of this day, creation emerges. At the dusk, all of creation dissolves back into the unmanifest source. And then, after a night of deep cosmic rest, a new day dawns, and the play begins again.
Krishna says, “I am the source of this great rhythm.” At the beginning of the cycle, I send forth all beings. They are helpless, under the sway of their own nature, their own past karmas. And at the end of the cycle, they all merge back into me.
But, he adds, these actions of creation and dissolution do not bind me. Why? Because I remain like one who is indifferent, udasinavad, unattached.
This is the great secret of Karma Yoga. Action binds only when there is attachment, when the ego is involved. When you act out of desire, you are bound. But the divine acts not out of desire, but out of a sheer explosion of joy. It is a play, a leela. A flower blooms, a star shines, a river flows. There is no motive. It is a spontaneous overflowing of energy. The divine is the creator, yet he remains a witness to his own creation. He is totally involved, yet utterly untouched. To act with this quality of detached playfulness is to be free.
