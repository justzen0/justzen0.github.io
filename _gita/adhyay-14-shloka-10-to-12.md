> O scion of the Bharata dynasty, sattva increases by subduing rajas and tamas; rajas increases by overpowering sattva and tamas; and tamas increases by dominating over sattva and rajas.<br><br>When the illumination of knowledge radiates through all the doors of the senses in this body, then one should know that sattva has greatly increased.<br><br>O best of the Bharata dynasty, when rajas becomes predominant, these come into being: avarice, restlessness, undertaking of actions, agitation, and craving.

### Osho’s Commentary
These three qualities are in a constant struggle for dominance within you. Sometimes sattva prevails, and you feel a moment of clarity, of peace. Sometimes rajas prevails, and you are full of a feverish energy to act. And sometimes tamas prevails, and you are drowned in inertia and darkness. Your inner world is a battlefield of these three forces.
Krishna gives you the signs to recognize which guna is dominant.
When sattva is predominant, the light of knowledge shines through all the gates of your body. Your senses become clear, your mind becomes transparent. There is a feeling of lightness, of joy, of deep understanding.
When rajas is predominant, greed arises. A great restlessness takes hold of you. You are constantly starting new actions, driven by a deep craving. There is no peace, no rest.
By observing these inner states, you can become aware of the play of the gunas within you. And this awareness is the first step towards transcending them.
