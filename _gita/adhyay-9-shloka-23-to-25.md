### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna’s vision is all-inclusive. He says even those who worship other gods with faith are in reality worshipping me.
I am the ultimate enjoyer of all sacrifices. All rivers flow into the same ocean. But they worship avidhipurvakam—ignorantly, without the right understanding. They do not know me as the ultimate source, and so they fall back into the cycle of rebirth.
Then he states a fundamental law: you become that which you worship. Your ideal determines your destiny.
Those who are devoted to the gods, attain to the world of the gods.
Those who are devoted to the ancestors, go to the world of the ancestors.
Those who worship the spirits, become one with the spirits.
And my devotees come to me.
This is a profound psychological key. The object of your deepest reverence, your ultimate value, shapes your consciousness. If you worship wealth, your soul becomes metallic. If you worship power, you become hard. If you worship pleasure, you become dissipated. But if you worship the supreme, eternal reality, you are transformed into that very reality.
The choice of your ideal is the most important choice of your life. For in choosing your god, you are choosing your own future being.
