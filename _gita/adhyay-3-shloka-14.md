### Osho’s Commentary
Here, Krishna outlines a great cosmic cycle, a wheel of life. All beings are born of food. Food comes from rain. Rain comes from Yajna, sacrifice. And Yajna comes from action.
The modern mind, the scientific mind, might find this strange. Rain comes from sacrifice? The scientist will say rain comes from clouds, from evaporation. But Krishna is pointing to a deeper ecology, a spiritual ecology, where man and nature are not separate but deeply interconnected.
When a man lives in harmony with the whole, when his life is an offering, a Yajna, he creates a certain vibration, a certain resonance in the cosmos. This harmony invites the forces of nature to be bountiful. The clouds gather, the rains fall, the earth becomes fertile. When humanity is filled with greed, conflict, and ego, it creates a disharmony, a dissonance. The balance of nature is disturbed.
This is not superstition; it is a profound truth that modern ecology is only just beginning to rediscover. We have treated nature as an enemy to be conquered, a resource to be exploited. And now we are facing the consequences: a dying planet.
The man of Yajna lives in deep reverence for life. His actions are not selfish. He is part of a great cosmic orchestra. He plays his part in tune with the whole. And the whole responds with love, with nourishment, with rain. This is not a mechanical process; it is a love affair between man and existence.
