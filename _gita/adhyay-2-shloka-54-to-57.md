### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna now asks a very significant question. He wants to know the outer signs of an enlightened man.
Krishna answers: The one whose mind is untroubled in sorrow, who is free from craving in pleasure, from whom passion, fear, and anger have departed—he is called a sage of steady wisdom. He who is without attachment on any side, who neither rejoices nor hates when he obtains good or evil—his wisdom is firmly set.
The enlightened man is not one who does not experience pleasure or pain. He experiences them, but he is not disturbed by them. He remains a balanced, centered witness to the whole play of life. His inner peace is not dependent on outer circumstances.
