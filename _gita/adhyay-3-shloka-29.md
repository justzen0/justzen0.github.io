> Those who are completely deluded by the gunas of Nature become attached to the activities of the gunas. The one who knows the All should not disturb those of dull intellect, who do not know the All.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna repeats his compassionate advice. Those who are deluded by the gunas are attached to actions. They identify with the play. They think they are the doer.
The one who knows the whole, the kritsnavit, the wise man, should not disturb these people, whom Krishna calls mandan, dull-witted, those who know only in part.
This requires great patience, great love. It is easy for the knowledgeable to become arrogant and to look down upon the ignorant. But a truly wise man is full of compassion. He understands that everyone is on a journey. Everyone is at a different stage of evolution.
He does not shake their simple faith. He does not shatter their small world. A ripe fruit falls from the tree on its own. A green fruit has to be plucked with force, and a wound is left on the tree. The wise man waits for the fruit to ripen. He creates the right atmosphere, the right conditions, but he does not use force. He knows that when the time is right, the ignorance will fall away on its own, and the light of knowing will shine forth.
