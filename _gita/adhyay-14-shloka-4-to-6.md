### Osho’s Commentary
In every womb, in every form that is born, nature is the mother and I am the father. And this mother, this Prakriti, has three qualities, three moods: sattva, rajas, and tamas. These three are the threads that weave the fabric of existence. And they bind the immortal soul to the mortal body.
Tamas is inertia, darkness, laziness. It is the pull of the earth, the pull of matter. It is a state of deep sleep, of unconsciousness.
Rajas is passion, energy, action. It is the force of life, the desire to do, to become, to achieve. It is a whirlwind of activity.
And Sattva is purity, balance, light, harmony. It is a state of quiet joy, of clarity, of wisdom.
You may think that sattva must be liberation. But Krishna says, "No." Sattva, too, is a bondage. It is the most beautiful, the most subtle, the most golden of all chains, but it is a chain nonetheless. It binds you through the attachment to happiness and the attachment to knowledge.
The pride of the virtuous man is the last and most difficult ego to drop. He feels, “I am happy, I am wise, I am pure.” This very “I” is the bondage. To be truly free, one must go beyond all three qualities—beyond the darkness of tamas, beyond the fever of rajas, and even beyond the subtle light of sattva. One must become a pure witness to the play of all three.
