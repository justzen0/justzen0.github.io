> With his heart unattached to external objects, he gets the bliss that is in the Self. With his heart absorbed in meditation on Brahman, he acquires undying Bliss.

### Osho’s Commentary
His happiness is no longer dependent on the outside world. He is bahyasparshesh-vasaktatma, unattached to the contacts of the outer senses.
He has found the wellspring of joy within himself, atmani yat sukham. This is a joy that is not borrowed, that cannot be taken away. It is his own intrinsic nature.
And with his being yoked to the divine, he enjoys a happiness that is akshayam, imperishable, endless. The pleasures of the world are momentary; they come and go, and always leave a shadow of pain behind. But the bliss of the Self is eternal. It is a constant, overflowing fountain of delight.
