### Osho’s Commentary
Another beautiful string of paradoxes to describe the indescribable.
It shines through all the senses, yet it has no senses. The light of a lamp shines on a flower. The light has no eyes, but without it, the eyes cannot see. The divine is that light of consciousness in which the senses function.
It is unattached, yet it sustains all. It is like the space in a room. It holds everything, the furniture, the people, yet it is untouched by them. The divine is the ultimate space in which the whole drama of existence unfolds.
It is nirgunam, without qualities, yet it is gunabhoktru, the enjoyer of qualities. It is the pure, colorless screen on which the colorful movie of the world is projected. The screen itself has no color, but without it, no color could be seen. It is the silent witness that enjoys the whole play without ever becoming a part of it.
