### Osho’s Commentary
He who knows my glory, my vibhuti, and my power, my yoga, in its very essence, he is united with me in unwavering yoga. And the wise, knowing that I am the source of all, worship me with a heart full of love.
What is this yoga? What is this glory? Splendor, opulence, beauty—aishwarya is the word. And from aishwarya comes the word Ishwara, God. Wherever there is a flowering of ultimate splendor, God is present.
Whether it is a flower blossoming to its ultimate beauty, or a song rising to a divine height, or a soul dissolving into the silence of meditation—wherever life reaches its peak, its zenith, there the divine is most manifest.
But we do not see it. We see a stone by the side of the road, and it is just a stone. But when that stone becomes a beautiful statue, something of the divine has become manifest in it. The divine is hidden in the stone, but when it becomes a beautiful form, it is more easily recognized. The divine is hidden in every man, but when a man becomes a Buddha, he becomes a window. Through him, you can glimpse the ultimate. This is his glory, his vibhuti.
But we do not see it. It is said that when Jesus was crucified, even then we could not see his splendor. We could not see his divinity. And so it is, my friend, that the greatest difficulty for man is to recognize the divine when it stands before him in human form. For then, our ego is hurt.
And knowing this, says Krishna, the wise worship me with love. For the divine can only be approached through love, through a heart that is open, that is filled with wonder.
