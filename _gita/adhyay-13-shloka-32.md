> Being without beginning and without end, O son of Kunti, this immutable, supreme Self does not act, nor is It affected [Also translated as tainted.-Tr.], although It exists in the body.

### Osho’s Commentary
Just as the all-pervading space is not tainted by anything, because of its subtlety, so too the Self, though it dwells in every part of the body, is not tainted.
This is a beautiful analogy. Space is everywhere, but it cannot be dirtied. You can throw dirt into it, but the space itself remains pure. So too is the Self. It is the ultimate space of consciousness. All the events of life, all the thoughts and emotions, pass through it, but it remains forever pure, forever untouched.
