> For the sage who wishes to ascend to (Dhyana-) yoga, action is said to be the means. For that person, once he has ascended to (Dhyana-)yoga, inaction alone is said to be the means.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna speaks of two stages on the path. For the one who is still aspiring to climb the peak of yoga, action is the means. But for the one who has already reached the peak, who is enthroned in yoga, tranquility itself becomes the means.
What is this tranquility, this shama? It is the state where the mind, which is a constant pendulum swinging between opposites, comes to a standstill. The yogi is not the opposite of the worldly man; the renouncer is the opposite. The yogi is the one who has gone beyond both extremes. He has found the center.
In the beginning, you use action to reach this center. You act, but you practice detachment. You are in the world, but you remain a witness. This is the path. But when you arrive, a new state blossoms. Action is no longer needed as a device. In that ultimate peace, that tranquility, there is no will, no sankalpa, no desire to do anything. You have become one with existence.
Action is the path, but stillness is the goal. When you are enthroned in yoga, even the thought of a path disappears. You have arrived home.
