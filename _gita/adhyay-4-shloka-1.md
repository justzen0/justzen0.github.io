### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna speaks of a truth that is neither new nor old. For that which is new will soon become old, and that which is old was once new. Both are caught in the river of birth and death. But truth is sanatan—eternal. And eternal means beyond time, beyond the tick-tock of the clock.
Krishna says, “I taught this in the beginning, to the Sun.” What does he mean? This is not a lesson in history; it is a revelation of a mystery. When a man dives into the deepest core of his being, all disappears but a silent, witnessing light. Creation begins with light and ends in light. The first and last event of this universe is light. So when Krishna says he taught the Sun, he is saying, “I spoke this truth to the very first phenomenon of light.” From that light, it was passed to Manu, the mind, and from the mind to Ikshvaku, the senses.
And the ‘I’ that speaks? It is not the body of Krishna that stands before Arjuna, a body born only a few years ago. It is the voice of the cosmos itself, the eternal ‘I’ that was before Abraham, that is before time itself. The ‘I’ of Krishna is the ‘I’ of existence.
