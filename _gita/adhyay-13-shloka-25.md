### Osho’s Commentary
And then there are those who do not have the capacity for deep meditation or profound philosophical inquiry. They simply hear the truth from an enlightened one and worship with deep faith, shruti-parayanah. They too, says Krishna, cross over death.
This is the path of pure devotion, of simple trust. It is not a path for everyone. It requires the heart of a child, a heart that can trust totally, without any doubt.
For such a heart, hearing from a master is enough. The master's words become a boat that carries them across the ocean of ignorance. Grace is the key on this path.
