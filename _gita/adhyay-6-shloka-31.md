### Osho’s Commentary
The one who is established in oneness and worships Me—the divine—in all beings, in whatever manner he lives and acts, he lives and acts in Me.
For such a person, all distinctions have disappeared. Sacred and profane, good and bad—everything has become a manifestation of the divine. His every act becomes an act of worship. Eating, walking, sleeping—his whole life becomes a sacred ritual.
He may live in the marketplace or in a monastery, it makes no difference. He is constantly abiding in the divine presence. He has realized that the kingdom of God is not a place, but a state of consciousness.
