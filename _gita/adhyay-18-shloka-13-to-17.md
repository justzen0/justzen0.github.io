### Osho’s Commentary
My friend, this is the great secret, the master-key. Krishna gives the five causes of all action: the body (the seat), the ego (the agent), the senses (the instruments), the life-energy (the effort), and finally, daivam, destiny, the cosmic will.
Whatever you do, right or wrong, is a product of these five. You, the pure Self, are not among them. You are the silent witness.
But the foolish man, due to an impure understanding, thinks, "I am the doer." He does not see the truth.
But the one who is free from this egoistic notion, whose intelligence is not tainted by the desire for results—even if he kills all these people, he does not kill, and he is not bound.
This is the state of the ultimate warrior, the spiritual warrior. His action flows not from his small, personal self, but from the vastness of the cosmic will. He has become an instrument, a hollow bamboo flute. The song that flows through him is not his, but of the divine. He acts, but he is not the actor. He is a pure witness. And in that witnessing, he is utterly free.
