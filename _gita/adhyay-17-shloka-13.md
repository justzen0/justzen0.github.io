> They declare that sacrifice as 'done through tamas' which is contrary to injunction, in which no food is distributed, in which no mantras are used, in which no offerings are made to priests, and which is devoid of faith.

### Osho’s Commentary
And the tamasic sacrifice is one that is performed without any understanding, without the proper rites. No food is shared, no sacred sounds are uttered, no gifts are given. And most importantly, it is shraddha-virahitam, devoid of faith.
It is a dead ritual, a mechanical act performed out of a dark, unconscious compulsion. It has no life, no love, no spirit in it. Such an action only pulls you deeper into the darkness of ignorance.
