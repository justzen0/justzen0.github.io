### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna now asks a most significant question, a question that must arise in the heart of every true seeker.
He asks, “What happens to the one who has faith, but whose mind wanders away from yoga, who fails to attain perfection? Having fallen from both—from the world and from the path to the divine—does he not perish like a scattered cloud, without any support? Please, Krishna, cut this doubt of mine completely. For no one but you can destroy this doubt.”
This is the fear of the seeker. What if I leave the world, and also fail to find God? I will be lost, belonging nowhere. This is a very real possibility. The path is long, and the mind is weak. What is the guarantee?
Arjuna’s question shows his sincerity. He is not just a philosopher; he is a seeker who is ready to stake his life. And he has a deep trust in Krishna, that only he can solve this ultimate riddle.
