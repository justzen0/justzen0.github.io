### Osho’s Commentary
And finally, the three kinds of actor.
The sattvic actor is free from attachment, free from the sense of "I am doing." He is full of fortitude and enthusiasm, and he is untouched by success or failure.
The rajasic actor is full of passion, desire, greed, and violence. He is a pendulum swinging between the excitement of joy and the misery of sorrow.
And the tamasic actor is unsteady, vulgar, stubborn, deceitful, lazy, and always full of despair and procrastination.
These are not just three types of people. These are three possibilities within you. You are a crowd. Sometimes you are sattvic, sometimes rajasic, sometimes tamasic. The art of yoga is to become aware of this inner drama, and to slowly, patiently, move from the darkness of tamas and the fever of rajas to the clear, silent light of sattva—and ultimately, to become a witness even to that.
