> Tell me who You are, fierce in form. Salutations to You, O Supreme God; be gracious. I desire to fully know You, who are the Prime One. For I do not understand Your actions!

### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna is completely bewildered. He asks, "Who are you, of this terrible form?" He offers salutations, and he begs for mercy. "I wish to know you," he says, "for I do not understand what you are doing."
All his previous concepts of God have been shattered. He is faced with a reality that is beyond his comprehension. This is the moment of true inquiry. When all your old answers have failed, when you are left in a state of complete unknowing, then a real question can arise from the depths of your being.
Arjuna is no longer a warrior, no longer a philosopher. He is just a bewildered soul, standing before the ultimate mystery, and asking, "Who are you?"
