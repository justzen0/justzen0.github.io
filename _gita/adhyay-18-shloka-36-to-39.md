### Osho’s Commentary
And now, the three kinds of happiness.
Sattvic happiness is that which is like poison in the beginning, but like nectar in the end. All spiritual discipline seems difficult at first. Meditation seems arduous. But if you persist, it leads to a bliss that is eternal. This is the happiness born of the clarity of your own soul.
Rajasic happiness is that which is like nectar in the beginning, but like poison in the end. This is the happiness of the senses. It is sweet at first, but it always leaves a bitter aftertaste of attachment, of craving, of pain.
And tamasic happiness is that which is delusive from beginning to end. It arises from sleep, from laziness, from unconsciousness. It is not happiness at all; it is just a state of stupor, a forgetting of one’s misery.
You are always seeking happiness, my friend. But look carefully. Are you seeking the nectar that turns to poison, or are you ready to drink the poison that turns to nectar? The choice is yours.
