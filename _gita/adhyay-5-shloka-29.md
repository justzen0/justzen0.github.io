> One attains peace by knowing Me, who am the great Lord of all the worlds, the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities, and the friend of all creatures.

### Osho’s Commentary
And the final secret. Peace is attained by knowing the divine in three ways:
As the ultimate enjoyer, bhoktaram, of all sacrifices and austerities. Whatever you offer, you offer to Him.
As the great Lord of all worlds, sarva-loka-maheshvaram. He is the supreme reality in which all worlds exist.
And as the friend of all beings, suhridam sarva-bhutanam. He is not a distant, fearsome God, but an intimate friend, a well-wisher to all of existence.
When you know the divine not as a philosophical concept but as this living reality—the ultimate source, the ultimate enjoyer, and the ultimate friend—then all fear, all struggle, dissolves. In this intimate knowing, you find the supreme peace, shantim.
