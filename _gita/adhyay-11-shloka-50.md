### Osho’s Commentary
And so Krishna showed Arjuna his own form again. And assuming his gentle form, saumya-vapuh, he comforted the terrified Arjuna.
The great drama is over. The infinite has withdrawn its overwhelming presence, and the gentle, loving form of the master is restored.
This is a beautiful interplay between the transcendent and the immanent aspects of the divine. The divine is both the terrifying, formless Absolute and the loving, personal God who comforts his devotee. The path is to know both, and to find the balance between awe and intimacy.
