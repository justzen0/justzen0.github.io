### Osho’s Commentary
This is the inner monologue of the demonic man. "Today I have gained this; tomorrow I will gain that. That enemy I have slain; others I will also slay. I am the Lord, the enjoyer, the perfect one. I am rich, I am powerful. Who is equal to me?"
Deluded by such ignorance, caught in a net of fantasies, addicted to sense-pleasures, they fall into a foul hell.
This hell is not a geographical place. It is the inner state of a mind that is constantly at war with others and with itself. A mind that is a prisoner of its own ego, its own desires. This is the ultimate suffering.
