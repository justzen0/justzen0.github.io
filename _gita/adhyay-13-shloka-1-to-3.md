If this verse is included, the total number of verses in the Bhagavad Gita is 701.<br><br>The Blessed Lord said, "O son of Kunti, this body is referred to as the 'field'. Those who are versed in this call him who is conscious of it the 'knower of the field'."<br><br>And, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, understand Me to be the 'Knower of the field' in all the fields. In My opinion, that is Knowledge which is the knowledge of the field and the knower of the field.

### Osho’s Commentary
For lifetimes you have searched for the cause of your misery, pointing your finger at everyone but yourself. You blame circumstances, you blame others, you even blame God. But I tell you, you are the seed of your own suffering. The only true bondage is your identification with that which you are not.
This body, Krishna says, is the kshetra, the field. It is the soil where all events happen—pleasure, pain, birth, death. It is the objective world, that which is seen. And you, the consciousness within, are the kshetrajna, the knower of the field. You are the witness, the one who watches.
This is not a philosophy, my friend, it is the key to a revolution. The whole art of religion is to create a distance between the knower and the known. When the body is hungry, you know, "Hunger is happening in the field." When a thought arises, you know, "A thought is passing through the field." You remain the watcher on the hills, untouched, unstained.
This knowing is the only alchemy. In this simple act of witnessing, the chains of identification are broken. You are no longer the pain, you are the one who knows the pain. In this knowing, you are free.
And Krishna gives the ultimate secret. He says, “I am the knower in all fields.” When you look deep within and find that silent witness, you have found Me. For that witness is not yours or mine; it is one. We are different fields, but the sky of consciousness that watches over all the fields is one. To know this one knower within is to know the divine.
