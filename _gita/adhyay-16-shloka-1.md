### Osho’s Commentary
Man is a duality, my friend, a paradox. He is a ladder between hell and heaven. The animal and the divine are both present within you. And you are the path, you are the traveler, and you are the destination. The journey is not outward, but inward.
The energy is one. The same energy that leads to hell can lead to heaven. It is only a question of direction. The journey towards the divine is what I call Daivi Sampada, the divine wealth. The journey away from it is the Asuri Sampada, the demonic wealth.
Krishna begins with the first quality of the divine man: Abhayam, fearlessness. But this is not the fearlessness of the brave soldier or the criminal. They are fearless, but their fear is only suppressed. True fearlessness is born only when you have had a glimpse of the immortal within you, when you know that death is a fiction. To know the deathless soul is to become fearless. This fearlessness is the first step on the path to the divine, for it is a journey into the ultimate unknown, a dissolution of the self. Only one who is utterly fearless can take that leap.
And then, sattva-sanshuddhi, the purity of one’s inner being. This is not the conditioned conscience given to you by society. That is just a borrowed morality. True purity is when you have washed away all these conditionings, when your own authentic consciousness, the one you were born with, begins to speak. That pure, unconditioned inner voice is the second quality.
