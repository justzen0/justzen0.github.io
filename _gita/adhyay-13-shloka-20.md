### Osho’s Commentary
Nature is the cause of all action. The body, the senses, the whole mechanism of doing, belongs to Prakriti.
But the Purusha, the spirit, is said to be the cause of the experience of pleasure and pain.
How? The events happen in nature. A flower blooms—that is nature. But the feeling, "This is beautiful," the experience of joy, happens in the Purusha. The Purusha, by identifying with the events of nature, by projecting its own feelings onto them, becomes the experiencer, the bhokta.
This is the root of all bondage. The spirit, which is in its essence a pure witness, gets entangled in the play of nature and starts to think, "I am happy, I am sad." To break this identification is the whole secret of liberation.
