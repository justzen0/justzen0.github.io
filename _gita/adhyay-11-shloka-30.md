### Osho’s Commentary
The divine is seen as a great cosmic fire, devouring and licking up all the worlds. Its fiery rays are burning the entire universe.
The vision is now one of total cosmic dissolution. Not just the death of individuals, but the end of the entire creation.
This is the face of Shiva, the destroyer. In the Hindu trinity, Brahma creates, Vishnu sustains, and Shiva dissolves. Arjuna is now seeing the face of the ultimate reality, which is all three in one. It is the great, terrifying, and ultimately liberating vision of a reality that is in a constant state of flux, of creation and destruction.
