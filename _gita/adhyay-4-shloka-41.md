### Osho’s Commentary
For the one who has reached the goal, Krishna says, actions do not bind. Who is this man?
He has renounced action through yoga. This means he acts, but the doer is not. He is in a state of nishkama karma, action without desire.
His doubts have been completely cut by knowledge. His mind is clear, unclouded.
He is atmavantam, established in his own Self. He is no longer identified with the mind or the body. He knows himself as the pure, witnessing consciousness.
For such a man, actions flow like a river, but they leave no trace. They cannot bind him. He has become free while living, a jivanmukta.
