> The seers whose sins have been attenuated, who are free from doubt, whose senses are under control, who are engaged in doing good to all beings, attain absorption in Brahman.

### Osho’s Commentary
Who are these sages who attain the supreme bliss? Krishna gives four qualities.
Their sins are destroyed, kshina-kalmashah. Their consciousness is pure.
Their dualities, their doubts, are cut asunder, chinna-dvaidha. Their vision is clear and undivided.
They are self-controlled, yatatmanah. They are masters of their own being.
And, most beautifully, they are sarva-bhuta-hite-ratah, engaged in the welfare of all beings.
Their liberation is not a selfish escape. Their enlightenment flowers into a deep compassion for all of existence. Their love overflows, and their very life becomes a blessing to the world.
