### Osho’s Commentary
Through these senses and the mind, the soul experiences the world. You have attracted these instruments to yourself because of a deep-seated desire to experience, to enjoy.
It is not the senses that have bound you, my friend. It is you who are clinging to them. The desire to see has created the eyes. The desire to hear has created the ears. Your consciousness has taken on these forms to experience the world.
When the desire to experience the outer world disappears, when the thirst turns inwards to experience the self, these very senses begin to wither away. Not that you become blind or deaf. But your energy no longer flows outwards through them. They become silent, inactive doors. And the whole of your life-force begins to move inwards, towards the ultimate experience of the divine.
