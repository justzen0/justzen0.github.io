> Neither do the demoniacal persons understand what should be done and what should not be done; nor do they possess purity, good conduct, or truthfulness.<br><br>They say that the world is unreal, having no basis, and without a God. It is born of mutual union brought about by passion! What other cause could there be?

### Osho’s Commentary
The demonic man knows not what to do and what to refrain from. His life has no inner compass. Purity, right conduct, truth—these are not found in him.
And his worldview is this: he says the world is asatyam, unreal, a lie. There is no truth in it. Apratishtham, it has no foundation, no basis in a higher reality. Anishwaram, there is no God, no creator, no cosmic intelligence.
How, then, did this world come to be? He says it is born of mutual union, with lust as its only cause. This is the materialistic, atheistic view. It sees the world as a cosmic accident, a chance happening, without any rhyme or reason. It is a world without a soul, without mystery. If this is the vision, then what is the purpose of life? There can be only one: to enjoy, to exploit, to grab whatever pleasure you can, for tomorrow you die. This vision is the very foundation of a life of conflict and misery.
