> By giving up attachment, the yogis undertake work solely through the body, mind, intellect, and even the organs, for their own purification.

### Osho’s Commentary
The yogis act with the body, mind, intellect, and senses—but only for one purpose: atmashuddhaye, for the purification of the self.
The ignorant man acts to gain something from the world—wealth, power, pleasure. His action is a means to possess something outside himself. The yogi acts to lose something within himself—his ego, his impurities, his ignorance.
The direction of the energy is completely reversed. The same actions—eating, working, relating—which for the ignorant man create more bondage, for the yogi become a process of liberation. The key is the abandonment of attachment. When the desire for the fruit is dropped, every act becomes a fire that purifies the soul, that burns away the dross, leaving only the pure gold of one’s essential being.
