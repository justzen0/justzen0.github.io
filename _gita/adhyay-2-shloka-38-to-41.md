### Osho’s Commentary
Treating pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat as equal, then fight. In this way, you will not incur sin.
Here, Krishna synthesizes the two paths. He has spoken of Sankhya, the path of knowledge. Now he speaks of Yoga, the path of action. The essence of this path is equanimity, samattva.
Act, but remain balanced in the pairs of opposites. This is the secret of Karma Yoga. And in this path, no effort is ever lost. Even a small step protects you from great fear.
The mind of the yogi is one-pointed, resolute. The mind of the worldly man is scattered in a thousand directions, endlessly branching out into desires and thoughts. To bring this scattered energy to a single point, to a total focus on the divine—this is the beginning of true yoga.
