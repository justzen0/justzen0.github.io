### Osho’s Commentary
More qualities of the awakened soul.
Yadrichhalabhasantushto—He is content with whatever comes by chance. He does not strive, he does not struggle. He accepts life as it comes, with a deep trust.
Dvandvatito—He has gone beyond all dualities. Pleasure and pain, honor and dishonor, heat and cold—he witnesses them all with an equal eye. He is no longer tossed about by the pairs of opposites.
Vimatsarah—He is free from envy, from jealousy. How can he be jealous? He is not comparing himself with anyone. He is living his own unique life.
Samah siddhavasiddhau—He is balanced in success and failure. The world may call him a success or a failure, but he remains untouched. His inner peace is not dependent on outer results.
Such a man, says Krishna, even when he acts, is not bound. He has found the unshakable center within himself.
