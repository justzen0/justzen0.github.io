### Osho’s Commentary
A radical and profound statement. The supreme Lord, the divine, does not create your sense of being a doer. It does not create your actions. It does not connect you to the fruits of your action.
Then who does? Swabhavastu pravartate—it is your own nature that functions. It is prakriti, the whole mechanism of nature, with its three gunas, that is acting.
We project our ideas onto God. We think God is a great manager, rewarding and punishing. Krishna shatters this childish notion. God is not a person; it is a presence. It is a catalytic agent in whose presence nature unfolds. But the functioning, the play of karma, is entirely the domain of nature. To understand this is to free God from our projections and to take full responsibility for our own state of being.
