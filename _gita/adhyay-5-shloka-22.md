> Since enjoyments that result from contact with objects are indeed the sources of sorrow, having a beginning and an end, O son of Kunti, the wise one does not delight in them.

### Osho’s Commentary
All pleasures that come from the contact of the senses with their objects are wombs of pain, duhkha-yonaya eva te.
Why? Because they are fleeting. They have a beginning and an end. A beautiful sunset, a sweet taste, a loving touch—they all pass. And when they pass, they leave behind a longing, a memory, a subtle pain of their absence. Every pleasure contains the seed of its own opposite.
The wise man, the budhah, understands this ephemeral nature of worldly pleasures. And so, he does not rejoice in them. He does not seek them. He enjoys them while they are there, as a witness, but he is not attached to them. His real delight is in the eternal, which has no beginning and no end.
