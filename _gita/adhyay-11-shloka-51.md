### Osho’s Commentary
Seeing your gentle human form, I am now composed, I have returned to my normal self.
Arjuna is relieved. He is back in the familiar world. The overwhelming experience is over.
But has he really returned to his old nature? No. A man who has had such a vision can never be the same again. The memory of it will continue to work within him, to transform him.
He may think he is back to his old self, but the seed of a great transformation has been planted. The vision of the infinite has shattered his old world, and now a new world, a new consciousness, will slowly begin to grow from its ruins.
