> O son of Prtha, the noble ones, being possessed of divine nature, surely adore Me with single-mindedness, knowing Me to be the immutable source of all objects.<br><br>Always glorifying Me and striving, the men of firm vows worship Me by paying obeisance to Me and being ever endowed with devotion.

### Osho’s Commentary
And the other side of the coin: the great souls, the mahatmas. They are those who have chosen the divine nature. Life offers two currents: one that flows downwards, into darkness, and one that flows upwards, into light. The mahatma is one who has chosen the upward path.
And how do they worship? With a single mind, ananya-manaso. Their whole being is focused on the divine. There is no other desire, no other thought. Their love is one-pointed.
They are always glorifying me. This is not empty praise. It is a state of constant remembrance, of seeing the divine hand in everything. They strive with firm resolve. Their seeking is not a part-time hobby; it is the passion of their whole life. They bow down with devotion. Their surrender is total.
This is the path of the devotee. It is a path of the heart. It is to be so absorbed in the divine that you yourself disappear. It is to become a song, a dance, a prayer offered at the feet of the ultimate. Such a one is ever-yoked, ever-united with the divine.
