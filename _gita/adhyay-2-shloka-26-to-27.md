> On the other hand, if you think this One is born continually or constantly dies, even then, O mighty-armed one, you should not grieve.<br><br>For the death of anyone born is certain, and the rebirth of the dead is certain. Therefore, you should not grieve over an inevitable fact.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now takes Arjuna's own argument and turns it on its head. He says, "Even if you do not accept my truth, even if you think that the soul is born and dies with the body, even then, there is no reason to grieve."
Why? Because that which is born must die, and that which dies must be born again. It is an inevitable cycle. To grieve over the inevitable is foolishness.
Whether you see reality from the highest peak of wisdom or from the ordinary standpoint of the world, in either case, grief is baseless. The wise man does not grieve because he knows the soul is immortal. The worldly man should not grieve because he knows that birth and death are an unavoidable law of nature. Grief is born only of a confused, partial vision.
