### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna describes the great cosmic rhythm. At the dawn of Brahma’s day, all things emerge from the unmanifest. At the coming of his night, they dissolve back into the unmanifest. This is the great cosmic breath—the out-breath is creation, the in-breath is dissolution.
And this whole multitude of beings is born again and again, helplessly caught in this cycle. But, says Krishna, beyond this unmanifest—the unmanifest from which creation arises—there is another, a higher unmanifest. An eternal, unmanifest reality.
This is a very subtle distinction. There is the unmanifest which is the seed of the manifest. It is the potential. And then there is the ultimate unmanifest, which is pure existence, beyond all potentiality of manifestation. It is the absolute. It is the screen on which the movie of creation and dissolution is projected. The movie comes and goes, but the screen remains, untouched, unstained. That is the ultimate reality, which never perishes.
