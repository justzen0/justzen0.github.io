### Osho’s Commentary
The one whose intellect is unattached, who has mastered himself and is free from desire—through renunciation, he attains the supreme perfection of naishkarmya, actionlessness.
This is not a state of doing nothing. It is a state where the doer has disappeared. And such a one becomes ready to merge with Brahman.
Krishna then describes the qualities of such a seeker. He is endowed with a pure intellect. He controls himself with firmness. He abandons the objects of the senses. He lives in solitude, eats little, and is constantly engaged in meditation. He has let go of all the manifestations of the ego—pride, power, lust, anger, possessions. He is free from the sense of “mine,” and he is utterly peaceful.
Such a man is a pure, empty vessel, ready to be filled with the divine. He has become fit to realize his own ultimate nature as Brahman.
