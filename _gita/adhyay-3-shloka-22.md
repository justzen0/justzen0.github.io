### Osho’s Commentary
Here, Krishna speaks from the highest peak of consciousness. He is speaking not as a person, but as the divine itself. He says, “For me, there is nothing to do.” He has no personal desire, no goal, no ambition. “There is nothing for me to gain.” He is already the whole. What more can be gained?
And yet, he says, “I am constantly engaged in action.”
Why? This is the great mystery of the avatara, the divine incarnation. He acts not for himself, but out of pure compassion, out of a love that knows no bounds. He has reached the destination, but he keeps walking on the path with those who are still struggling, just to give them company, just to hold their hand.
His presence is a pure gift. His actions are a play, a leela. He is like a man who has awakened from a dream but continues to act within the dream for the sake of those who are still asleep. His actions are a gesture of infinite grace.
