### Osho’s Commentary
The unwise delight in the flowery words of the scriptures, which promise heavenly rewards for ritualistic actions. Their minds are full of desires, and their highest goal is heaven. They are caught in a web of elaborate rituals.
Krishna is making a sharp distinction between the outer religion of rituals and the inner religion of consciousness.
The Vedas, he says, deal with the three gunas. You, Arjuna, must go beyond them. Be free from the pairs of opposites, established in pure being, not caring for acquisition or preservation.
Just as a man has no need for a small pond when there is a great flood of water everywhere, so too, for an enlightened Brahmin, there is no need for all the Vedas.
The scriptures are for those who are still in darkness. They are small lamps. But for the one who has seen the sun of his own Self, all these lamps become useless. The ultimate knowledge is not in any book; it is within you.
