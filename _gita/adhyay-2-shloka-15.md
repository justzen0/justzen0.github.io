### Osho’s Commentary
The one who is not disturbed by these opposites, who is balanced in pleasure and pain, he is ready for immortality.
Immortality is not something to be achieved after death. It is a state of consciousness to be realized here and now. When you are no longer identified with the changing world of the senses, when you have found your center in the unchanging witness, you have already tasted the nectar of immortality. You have realized that you are that which is beyond birth and death.
