### Osho’s Commentary
A tremendously beautiful and profound statement. God is a perfect mirror, a cosmic echo. In whatever way you approach him, he responds in kind.
If you come with love, you will be met with infinite love. If you come with a challenge, you will be met with a challenge. If you approach him as a friend, he becomes your friend. If you see him as a master, he is your master. If you do not see him at all, he respects your freedom and remains invisible to you.
Existence simply reflects you. Your life is your own creation. What you give, you receive, multiplied a thousandfold. A hateful heart finds a hateful world. A loving heart finds a loving existence.
And in the end, says Krishna, all paths lead to me. Mama vartmanuvartante—all men follow my path. The atheist, the theist, the sinner, the saint—they are all walking towards the same ultimate destination, whether they know it or not. Some are taking a shortcut, some a long and winding road. Some walk forwards, some backwards. But every step, taken in any direction, ultimately leads to the ocean of the divine.
