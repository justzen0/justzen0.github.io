### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna describes the two possibilities for the one who has fallen from the path of yoga.
Either he is born in the house of the pure and prosperous. There, he will have the right conditions, the right atmosphere, to continue his spiritual journey. Or, and this is more rare, he is born in a family of wise yogis.
In such a family, he regains the spiritual consciousness of his previous life and strives even more for perfection.
The point is this: existence is compassionate. It gives you another chance, and another. It provides you with the right environment, the right opportunities, to continue from where you left off. Your past efforts are never lost. They become the subtle tendencies, the samskaras, that will guide your future birth.
