> As the numerous currents of the waters of rivers rush towards the sea alone, so too do those heroes of the human world enter into Your blazing mouths.

### Osho’s Commentary
A beautiful and terrible metaphor. Just as rivers helplessly rush towards the ocean, so too are all these heroes rushing towards their death, into the flaming mouths of the divine.
There is a sense of inevitability, of a force that cannot be resisted. The individual is like a drop of water in a great river, being carried towards a destiny that is not of his own making.
This vision can be either liberating or terrifying. For the ego, which wants to be in control, it is terrifying. But for the soul that is ready to surrender to the cosmic flow, it is a great liberation. It is to understand that you are part of a larger whole, and to find your peace in that understanding.
