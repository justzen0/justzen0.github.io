> But those who, finding fault where there is none, do not follow My teaching, know them—who are deluded about all knowledge concerning the qualified and the unqualified Brahman and who are devoid of discrimination—to have gone to ruin.

### Osho’s Commentary
And the opposite. Those who find fault, who approach this teaching with a skeptical, argumentative mind, who do not put it into practice—know them to be lost.
They are sarvajnanavimudhan, deluded in all their knowledge. They may be great scholars, great intellectuals, but their knowledge is of no use. It is borrowed knowledge, dead information. It has not transformed their being.
They are nashtan, lost. And achetasah, without a true consciousness. Their mind is just a mechanical instrument, a computer filled with data. But the soul, the true intelligence, is asleep.
Knowledge that does not lead to transformation is a burden. It is better to be ignorant and innocent than to be knowledgeable and arrogant. The path that Krishna is showing is not a path of intellectual understanding, but of existential transformation. It has to be lived, not just debated.
