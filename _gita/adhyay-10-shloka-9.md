### Osho’s Commentary
For those whose minds and very life-breath are given to me, who enlighten each other, speaking of me, they find contentment and joy.
This is the nature of the devotee. But it is not what we think it is. It is not that two devotees sit together and talk about God. No. It is that when two enlightened souls are together, their very presence becomes an illumination for each other. When a Buddha is born, he may not speak a word, but his very presence becomes a sermon. His silence speaks.
We speak with words. A Buddha speaks with his being. He radiates a certain energy, a certain light. Those who are receptive can drink of that light.
But we are so full of words. Our minds are a constant noise. How can we hear the silent music of an enlightened one? We must first become silent ourselves. And in that silence, a new kind of dialogue begins. Not of words, but of being. A silent transmission. This is what Krishna means by "enlightening one another."
