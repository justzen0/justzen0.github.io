### Osho’s Commentary
Duryodhana, having assessed the enemy, now turns to his own side. He lists his great warriors. But his vision is clouded. He sees only the outer strength, the names, the reputations. He sees Bhishma, the grandsire, and he thinks Bhishma’s strength is his. But Bhishma is fighting out of compulsion, not conviction. His heart is not in this war. A body fighting without a heart is just a corpse.
Duryodhana thinks Bhishma is protecting his army. But in reality, Bhishma is a divided man. And a divided man cannot protect anyone; he can only lead to ruin. On the other side, the Pandava army is protected by Bhima. Bhima is a man of one piece. There is no conflict in him. His whole being is a spear pointed in one direction.
Duryodhana lives in the world of appearances. He sees the quantity, not the quality. He sees the great names, but not the divided hearts behind them. And this is the tragedy of every worldly man. He counts his possessions, his allies, his strengths, but he never looks at the quality of his own consciousness. One man who is totally integrated is more powerful than a million who are inwardly fragmented. The Pandavas may have a smaller army, but they have Krishna. They have the presence of the whole. And the whole is always greater than the sum of its parts.
