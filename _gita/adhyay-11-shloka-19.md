> I see You as having no beginning, middle, or end, possessing infinite valor, with innumerable arms, the sun and moon as eyes, a mouth like a blazing fire, and heating up this universe with Your own brilliance.

### Osho’s Commentary
He sees a form without beginning, middle, or end. A form of infinite power. The sun and moon are its eyes. Its mouth is a blazing fire, heating the entire universe.
Now the vision is shifting from the beautiful to the terrible. The divine is not just the creator, the sustainer. It is also the destroyer. Life and death, creation and destruction, are two sides of the same coin.
Arjuna is now beginning to see the other face of God, the face that is terrifying. The same energy that creates also destroys. The sun that gives life can also burn. The divine is not just a comforting presence; it is also a consuming fire. To know the divine in its totality is to know both these aspects.
