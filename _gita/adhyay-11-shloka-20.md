> Indeed, this intermediate space between heaven and earth, as well as all the directions, are pervaded by You alone. O exalted One, the three worlds are struck with fear upon seeing this strange and fearful form of Yours.

### Osho’s Commentary
The entire space is filled with this one form. And seeing this terrible form, ugram rupam, the three worlds are trembling.
The vision is no longer just of glory and light. It is now becoming terrifying. And it is not just Arjuna who is trembling; the entire cosmos is trembling.
This is because the vision of the total reality shatters all our illusions of security. We live in a small, man-made world of safety and order. But the ultimate reality is a wild, chaotic, terrifying dance of creation and destruction. To see this is to have the very ground beneath your feet taken away. It is to face the ultimate insecurity, the ultimate mystery.
