### Osho’s Commentary
He is the same to friend and foe, in honor and dishonor. He is balanced in all the dualities of life.
He is mauni, silent. This is not just an absence of outer speech. It is a deep inner silence, where the chattering of the mind has ceased.
He is content with whatever comes his way.
He is aniketah, homeless. This does not mean he lives on the street. It means he has no sense of possessiveness about any place. The whole world is his home, and yet he is a pilgrim, always on the move.
His mind is steady, and he is full of devotion.
This is the portrait of a man who has found his ultimate freedom. He is rooted in his own being, and nothing in the world can disturb his inner peace. He is a free soul, a lover of God. Such a one is dear to me.
