### Osho’s Commentary
No being on earth or in heaven is free from these three gunas. All are under their sway.
And the duties of the four varnas are distributed according to the qualities born of their own nature. This is not a system of social hierarchy, my friend. It is a profound psychological classification.
The Brahmin is one whose nature is sattvic. His natural work is that of the mind, of the spirit—serenity, knowledge, wisdom.
The Kshatriya is one whose nature is rajasic. His natural work is that of power, of action—heroism, leadership, generosity.
The Vaishya is one in whom rajas and tamas are mixed. His natural work is production, trade.
And the Shudra is one whose nature is tamasic. His natural work is that of service.
To follow one’s own intrinsic nature is swadharma. To try to be someone else is to create conflict and misery. Find your own unique quality, and let your life be a flowering of that quality.
