> But those devotees who accept Me as the supreme Goal, and with faith seek for this ambrosia—nectar in the form of virtue—which is indistinguishable from the virtues as stated above, they are very dear to Me.

### Osho’s Commentary
And finally, Krishna says, those who follow this immortal path of dharma, this path of love, with a heart full of faith, regarding me as their supreme goal—they are ativa me priyah, exceedingly dear to me.
This is the culmination of the path of devotion. It is not a path of dry rules and regulations. It is a path of the heart, a path of love, of faith, of surrender.
The one who walks this path does not have to struggle with himself. He simply has to open his heart to the divine. And in that opening, a great transformation happens. He does not attain God; he is attained by God. He does not find love; he is found by love. And he becomes exceedingly dear to the heart of existence itself.
