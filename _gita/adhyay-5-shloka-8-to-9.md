### Osho’s Commentary
The one who knows the truth—the tattvavit—even while engaged in all the activities of life, from seeing and hearing to speaking and breathing, remains convinced of one thing: “I am not the doer.”
This is the great shift in consciousness. The ignorant man thinks, “I am seeing, I am hearing, I am walking.” The wise man knows that the senses are simply functioning according to their nature. The eyes are instruments for seeing; the ears are instruments for hearing. It is a mechanical process, a play of nature. The real “I”, the pure consciousness, is just a witness.
It is a profound state of dis-identification. You are in the body, but you are not the body. You are using the senses, but you are not the senses. You are a detached observer, a watcher on the hills. For such a person, action continues, but the bondage of action disappears, because the actor is no more.
