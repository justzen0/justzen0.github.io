### Osho’s Commentary
Only the immature, the childish (balah), speak of the path of knowledge and the path of action as being separate, says Krishna. The wise (panditah) see them as one.
Why? Because they are two doors to the same temple. One who enters through the door of desireless action will inevitably find the flame of knowledge burning within. And one who enters through the door of knowledge will find that his actions have become spontaneously desireless.
These are not contradictory paths; they are two sides of the same coin. They appear different only at the starting point. As you go deeper, you will find them merging. One who is truly established in either path will find the fruit of both. The action becomes infused with knowledge, and the knowledge becomes expressed through loving action. To argue about which path is superior is a sign of ignorance.
