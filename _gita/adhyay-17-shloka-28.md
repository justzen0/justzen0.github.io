असदित्युच्यते पार्थ न च तत्प्रेत्य नो इह ॥17.28॥

> Whatever is sacrificed, given, or performed, and whatever austerity is practiced, without faith, it is called "Asat," O Partha. It is of no account here or hereafter.

### Osho’s Commentary
But whatever is done without shraddha, without faith, is Asat—it is unreal, it is nothing. It has no value, neither in this world nor in the next.
This is the final and most crucial point. Faith is the one essential ingredient. You can perform all the rituals, all the austerities, but if your heart is not in it, if there is no deep trust, your actions are hollow, empty.
Faith is not blind belief. It is a deep, existential trust in the goodness of existence. It is the quality that opens your heart to receive the divine grace. Without this, all your spiritual efforts are like sowing seeds on a barren rock. With this, even the smallest act becomes a doorway to the infinite.
