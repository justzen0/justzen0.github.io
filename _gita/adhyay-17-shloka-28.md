> O son of Prtha, whatever is offered in sacrifice and given in charity, as also whatever austerity is undertaken or whatever is done without faith, is said to be of no avail. And it is of no consequence after death, nor here.

### Osho’s Commentary
But whatever is done without shraddha, without faith, is Asat—it is unreal, it is nothing. It has no value, neither in this world nor in the next.
This is the final and most crucial point. Faith is the one essential ingredient. You can perform all the rituals, all the austerities, but if your heart is not in it, if there is no deep trust, your actions are hollow, empty.
Faith is not blind belief. It is a deep, existential trust in the goodness of existence. It is the quality that opens your heart to receive the divine grace. Without this, all your spiritual efforts are like sowing seeds on a barren rock. With this, even the smallest act becomes a doorway to the infinite.
