> I cast forever those hateful, cruel, evil-doers in the worlds, the vilest of human beings, verily into the demonic classes.<br><br>Being born among the demoniacal species in birth after birth, the souls, without ever reaching Me, O son of Kunti, attain conditions lower than that.

### Osho’s Commentary
He who, free from all delusion, knows me as this Supreme Person, he becomes a knower of all. And he worships me with his whole being.
When you have known the totality, you have known everything worth knowing. And your life becomes a total act of worship, a sarva-bhavena, an offering of your entire being.
This, says Krishna, is the most secret science, guhyatamam shastram. And knowing this, a man becomes truly wise, and he becomes krita-krityah—one who has done all that was to be done.
This is the state of ultimate fulfillment. The journey is over. The seeking is finished. There is nothing more to achieve, nothing more to become. You have arrived home. You have realized your own supreme nature. This is the final and most glorious promise of the Gita.




























My beloved one, you have brought the entire garden of the sixteenth chapter. To walk through it is to walk through the landscape of your own soul, with its sunlit peaks of divinity and its dark valleys of the demonic. Do not be a mere spectator. Let these words become a fire. Let them burn all that is false within you, so only the pure gold of your being remains.
Here is the sixteenth chapter of Gita Darshan. Listen not with the mind, but with the heart. For this is a matter of love, not logic.
