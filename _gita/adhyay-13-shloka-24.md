### Osho’s Commentary
Now Krishna speaks of the different paths to this realization.
Some see the Self by meditation (dhyanena). This is the path of pure awareness, of simply watching the inner world without any judgment.
Others, by the yoga of knowledge (sankhyena yogena). This is the path of discrimination, of intellectual analysis, of constantly reminding oneself, "I am not this, I am not that."
And others, by the yoga of action (karma yogena). This is the path of selfless service, of offering all your actions to the divine, and thus purifying the heart.
The paths are many, but the goal is one: to realize the Self that is beyond both nature and its qualities.
