### Osho’s Commentary
The manifest world is like a garland of jewels. Each jewel is beautiful, unique—a star, a flower, a human being. We see the jewels, but we do not see the thread that runs through them, that holds them all together.
Krishna says, “I am that thread.”
The manifest is the seen; the unmanifest is the unseen. The manifest is the form; the unmanifest is the formless. And the manifest rests upon the unmanifest, just as the waves rest upon the ocean. To get lost in the forms—the jewels—is to live in the world. To seek the thread that holds them all is the beginning of religion.
Krishna also says, “I am the source and the dissolution.” The whole drama of existence arises from me and dissolves back into me. This is a very Eastern concept. God is not just the creator, but also the destroyer. Life and death are not two opposing forces; they are two hands of the same divine reality. To see God in creation is easy. To see him in destruction, to see death as a deep rest, a return to the source—this requires a profound understanding.
