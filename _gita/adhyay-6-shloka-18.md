### Osho’s Commentary
When does one become a true yogi? When the mind, perfectly disciplined, rests in the Self alone.
The mind is always running outwards, towards objects, towards desires. It is like a restless monkey. The whole work of yoga is to bring this mind back home, to let it rest in its own source, the pure consciousness of the Self.
And when it rests there, it becomes free from all longings, nihsprihah. It no longer needs anything from the outside, because it has found the infinite treasure within.
This is the state of contentment. Not the contentment of a lazy man who desires nothing, but the contentment of one who has found the ultimate and for whom all lesser desires have simply fallen away. He is a king in his own right. He is a true yogi.
