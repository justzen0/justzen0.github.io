> The Blessed Lord said, "This desire, this anger, born of the quality of rajas, is a great devourer, a great source of sin. Know this to be the enemy here."

### Osho’s Commentary
Here is the answer. The enemy is not outside. The enemy is within. It is kama, desire, and krodha, anger.
And where do they come from? They are rajogunasamudbhavah, born of the quality of rajas. Rajas is the principle of activity, of passion, of energy. When this energy is not guided by awareness, when it is not balanced by sattva (purity) and grounded by tamas (inertia), it becomes a destructive force.
This desire is mahashano, all-devouring. It is insatiable. The more you feed it, the more it wants. It is a fire that consumes your whole life.
And it is mahapapma, a great sinner. All sin is born of this untamed, passionate desire.
Know this to be the enemy, says Krishna. He is not saying that desire or anger should be suppressed. He is saying they should be known, they should be understood. The whole science of yoga is the science of transforming this raw energy of rajas. When this same energy is purified and guided by awareness, desire becomes love, and anger becomes compassion.
The enemy is not the energy itself, but the ignorant way in which we use it.
