### Osho’s Commentary
In that one body, Arjuna saw the entire universe, with all its manifold divisions, united in one.
This is the experience of unity. We see a world of fragments. We see a tree, a man, a star, as separate entities. But in this vision, all separation dissolves. The many become one. All of existence is seen as a single, interconnected organism.
This is the ultimate perspective of Advaita, of non-duality. The experience of this unity shatters the ego. The sense of being a separate individual disappears. You become one with the whole.
And Arjuna, filled with wonder, his hair standing on end, bowed down. This is not a formal gesture. It is a spontaneous happening. When you are faced with a reality so vast, so overwhelming, the ego simply melts. The bowing down is not something you do; it is something that happens to you. It is the only possible response to the infinite.
