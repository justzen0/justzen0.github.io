> And I am seated in the hearts of all. From Me come memory, knowledge, and their loss. I alone am the object to be known through all the Vedas; I am also the originator of the Vedanta, and I Myself am the knower of the Vedas.

### Osho’s Commentary
I am seated in the hearts of all. This is the ultimate truth. The divine is your own innermost core.
From me come memory and knowledge. And also apohanam, their removal, the process of discrimination, of going beyond. The mind remembers, the mind knows, but the divine is that which is beyond the mind, that which can witness the mind and let it go.
I am the one to be known through all the scriptures. I am the author of the ultimate knowing, the Vedanta. And I am the knower of the Vedas.
The scriptures are just fingers pointing to the moon. The divine is the moon itself. The scriptures can give you clues, but the ultimate knowing comes only when you turn within and find the divine seated in your own heart. That is the final Veda, the ultimate knowledge.
