> You destroy Drona, Bhisma, Jayadratha, Karna, and the other heroic warriors who have been killed by Me. Do not be afraid. Fight! You will conquer the enemies in battle.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna names the great warriors. They are already slain by me, he says. "Do not be distressed. Just fight."
This is the ultimate reassurance. When you know that you are aligned with the cosmic will, when you know that victory is already yours, then you can act without fear, without anxiety.
This is not a call to fatalistic inaction. It is a call to courageous, joyful action, performed with the understanding that you are not alone, that the entire cosmos is supporting you. It is to act as a co-creator with the divine, as a willing participant in the great cosmic dance.
