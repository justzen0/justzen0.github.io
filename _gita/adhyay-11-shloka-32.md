### Osho’s Commentary
And Krishna gives the answer: "I am Time, the great destroyer."
This is one of the most profound statements in the Gita. The ultimate reality is not a person, not a being, but the dynamic, all-consuming force of Time, Kala.
Everything that is born in time is destroyed by time. Time is the great devourer. And Krishna says, "Even without you, Arjuna, all these warriors will be destroyed."
This is the ultimate statement of destiny. The outcome of the battle is already decided. Arjuna's role is not that of a doer, but of an instrument, a nimitta. He is just a vehicle through which the cosmic will is being expressed.
