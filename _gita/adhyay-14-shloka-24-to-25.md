### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna continues to describe the man who has transcended the gunas. He is a man of perfect equanimity.
Pleasure and pain are the same to him. A lump of clay, a stone, and a piece of gold are of equal value. The dear and the un-dear, praise and blame, honor and dishonor, friend and foe—he is balanced in all these pairs of opposites. He has abandoned all selfish undertakings.
This is a man who has moved beyond all the judgments of the mind. He sees the world with an equal eye, because he has realized the one, undivided reality that underlies all these apparent differences. He lives in a state of profound peace, because he is no longer pulled and pushed by the dualities of the world. He has found his freedom in the great, silent center of his own being.
