> The self-restrained man stays awake during what is night for all creatures. That which creatures stay awake for, it is night to the discerning sage.<br><br>That man attains peace into whom all desires enter, just as waters flow into the sea that remains unchanged even when filled from all sides. Not so one who is desirous of objects.<br><br>That man attains peace who, after rejecting all desires, moves about free from hankering, without the idea of 'me' and 'mine', and devoid of pride.<br><br>O Partha, this is the state of being established in Brahman. One does not become deluded after attaining this; one attains identification with Brahman by being established in this state even in the closing years of one's life.

### Osho’s Commentary
What is night for the worldly man—the inner world of the Self—is broad daylight for the sage. And what is daylight for the worldly man—the outer world of sense-objects—is dark night for the sage.
Their worlds are completely reversed. They live in two different dimensions of reality.
Just as the ocean remains unmoved, though the waters of all rivers enter into it, so too, the sage in whom all desires enter finds peace—not the desirer of desires.
He who abandons all desires and acts free from longing, without the sense of "I" and "mine"—he attains to peace.
This, O Partha, is the Brahmi state. Having attained it, one is not deluded. Being established in it even at the hour of death, one attains the bliss of Brahman. This is the ultimate goal, the final resting in one’s own true nature.
