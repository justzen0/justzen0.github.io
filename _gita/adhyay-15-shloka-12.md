> That light in the sun which illuminates the whole world, that which is in the moon, and that which is in fire—know that light to be Mine.

### Osho’s Commentary
The light that shines in the sun, in the moon, in the fire—know that to be my light.
We see the light of the sun, but we do not see the ultimate source of that light. The sun is just a lamp. The electricity that makes it shine is divine.
Krishna is constantly pointing from the manifest to the unmanifest. He is saying, "Look at the sun, but don't stop there. Look deeper. See the invisible source of its radiance. That is Me." To see the divine light in all the lights of the world is to transform your vision.
