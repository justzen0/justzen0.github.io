### Osho’s Commentary
A strange statement! Among millions, only one seeks. Among millions of seekers, only one finds. Why? Is the path so difficult? Is God hiding? No. The path is simple, God is utterly available. The difficulty is with man.
A fish is born in the ocean, lives in the ocean, dies in the ocean. It searches for everything, but never for the ocean. It cannot. It is too close, too obvious. We are fish in the ocean of God. He is so present, so all-encompassing, that we do not notice him.
The mind has a peculiar habit: it runs towards what is lacking. The tooth that is gone, the tongue returns to it again and again, to the empty space. God is the ultimate presence, the absolute fullness. There is no empty space in him. So the mind simply ignores him. It runs towards money, power, fame—all the things that are absent.
The whole secret is to reverse this flow of the mind. Be content. Not the contentment of a lazy man, but the contentment that is a deep gratitude for what is. The moment you start seeing what you have—the breath, the heartbeat, the sky, the trees—a new thirst arises. A thirst not for more things, but for the very source of this existence. This is the mind of a seeker.
