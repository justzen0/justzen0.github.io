### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna describes the object of meditation and the final process of departure.
He meditates on the divine, which is the Kavi—the ultimate poet, the seer. Puraanam—the most ancient, beyond time. Anushasitaram—the subtle ruler of all. Subtler than the atom, the sustainer of all. Inconceivable, luminous like the sun, beyond all darkness.
And at the final moment, the one who is filled with devotion, with the power of yoga, centers his life-force, his prana, between his eyebrows, at the third eye. This is a very scientific process. Our consciousness has two primary centers of outflow: the sex center and the third eye. The whole of life, our energy flows downwards through the sex center, creating the world. The whole of yoga is the art of reversing this flow, of moving the energy upwards. The third eye is the door to the beyond. When the life-force is focused there with an unwavering mind, one passes beyond the body, into the supreme light.
Then Krishna speaks of that which the knowers of the Veda—not the book, but of knowing itself—call the Imperishable. The word Veda means knowing. The word Aksharam means that which is never destroyed. This is the Omkar, the soundless sound, the eternal vibration that is the very fabric of existence. The sages, free from all passion, enter into this. Desiring this, they practice brahmacharya—not just celibacy, but the path of moving towards Brahman. It is the conscious channeling of all life-energy towards the divine. This is the supreme state.
