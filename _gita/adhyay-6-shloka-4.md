### Osho’s Commentary
Who is this man who is enthroned in yoga? Krishna defines him. He is one who is not attached to the objects of the senses, nor to actions. He has renounced all selfish will.
Understand this deeply. The attachment to action is only a shadow of the attachment to sense objects. We act because we desire the pleasure that the senses can provide. If money could not buy anything for the senses, who would desire money?
The root of all bondage is in the senses. We have become so identified with the body and its senses that we have forgotten the witness who is behind them. The whole path is a process of dis-identification.
Try this simple experiment. When you feel hungry, just watch. Know that the body is hungry, not “I.” When you feel an emotion, just watch. Know that the mind is feeling it, not “I.” In this small gap of witnessing, a great freedom is born. The moment you realize you are not the body, not the senses, attachment to their objects falls away. And with it, the attachment to action also disappears. In that moment, you are enthroned in yoga.
