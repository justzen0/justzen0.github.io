### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna’s compassion is boundless. He opens the doors of liberation to everyone, without any distinction of birth, caste, or gender.
Even those of papayonayah, of sinful birth—and he includes women, vaishyas (the merchant class), and shudras (the laboring class) in this category—even they, if they take refuge in me, can attain the supreme.
This was a radical departure from the orthodox view of his time, which held that the path to liberation was open only to the male Brahmin. Krishna is a great spiritual democrat. For him, what matters is not the outer circumstance of your birth, but the inner turning of your heart.
And if these can attain the goal, how much more easily can the holy Brahmins and the devout kings?
Therefore, he concludes, having been born into this world, which is anityam, transient, and asukham, joyless, the only sane thing to do is to worship me. In the face of the fleeting and unsatisfactory nature of worldly life, the only true refuge is in the eternal.
