> Those whose intellect is absorbed in That, whose Self is That, who are steadfast in That, and who have That as their supreme Goal—they attain the state of non-returning, their impurities having been removed by Knowledge.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna describes the state of total absorption in the divine.
Their intellect, their very self, is one with That. They are established in That. That is their only goal.
For such beings, whose whole consciousness has merged with the supreme, they attain a state from which there is no return, apunaravritti. They are freed from the cycle of birth and death.
Why? Because all their impurities, their sins, have been washed away by the purifying water of knowledge. The seed of karma, which forces one to be reborn, has been completely burned. They have dissolved back into the source, like a drop of water returning to the ocean.
