### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna does not hear. He is deaf to Krishna’s surgery. The ego is such a thick armor. Krishna strikes at his ego, and Arjuna simply picks up a new shield. He says, “How can I fight my revered teachers, Bhishma and Drona?”
But is this reverence? Or is it another beautiful argument, another shield for the ego? Look at the mechanism of the mind. It is so subtle. Now he is not speaking of his own pity; he is speaking of their worthiness to be worshipped. But the emphasis is still the same: "How can I fight them?" The "I" remains at the center.
He is not listening to what Krishna is saying. He is caught in his own inner monologue. We all do this. We hear only what we want to hear. We select, we interpret, we project. A true dialogue happens only when you are utterly empty, silent, receptive. Arjuna is still full of himself, of his own arguments, of his own self-image as a good, reverent man. And as long as he is full, Krishna’s words cannot penetrate him.
