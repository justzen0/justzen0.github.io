### Osho’s Commentary
The whole play of life is a play of duality, of opposites. Attachment and aversion, raga and dvesha. Liking and disliking. Love and hate. These are the two poles between which the mind constantly oscillates.
These two are seated in the senses. The senses come in contact with an object, and immediately, the mind labels it as “good” or “bad,” “pleasurable” or “painful.” And the whole drama of attraction and repulsion begins.
Krishna says, “Do not come under the power of these two.” They are your enemies, your paripanthinau, robbers on the path. They rob you of your peace, of your centeredness.
The wise man is one who stands as a witness between these two poles. He sees the attraction arising, he sees the aversion arising, but he does not identify with either. He remains in the middle, in the space of non-judgmental awareness.
This is the whole secret of meditation. To watch the play of opposites without getting involved. When you can do this, you have found the key to freedom. The dualities are still there, the world of opposites continues, but you are no longer a victim of it. You have become the master.
