> The yogi should bring this mind under the subjugation of the Self itself, restraining it from all those causes that cause the restless, unsteady mind to wander away.

### Osho’s Commentary
The mind is restless, unsteady. It will wander. This is its nature. Do not fight with it. Do not be disturbed by it.
From wherever it wanders, gently bring it back. If it goes to the past, bring it back. If it goes to the future, bring it back. Gently, lovingly, without any struggle, bring it back to the present moment, to the witness.
This is the whole art of meditation. Not a fight, but a gentle persuasion. The mind is like a child. If you fight with it, it will become more rebellious. If you are patient and loving with it, it will slowly begin to listen. And a moment comes when it wanders no more. It rests silently in the Self.
