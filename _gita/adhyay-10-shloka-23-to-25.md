### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna continues to give symbols of his supreme manifestation.
He chooses Shankara, another name for Shiva, the lord of transformation and destruction. He chooses Kubera, the lord of wealth. He chooses Brihaspati, the priest of the gods. He chooses Skanda, the general of the divine army. He chooses the ocean, the Himalaya.
And then, two very significant symbols. “Of the words, I am the one syllable, OM.” OM is not just a word. It is the primordial vibration, the soundless sound, from which all of creation is said to have emerged. To meditate on this inner sound is one of the profoundest paths.
“Of all sacrifices, I am japa-yajna.” Japa is the silent repetition of a mantra, a sacred name. It is a way of creating a continuous inner vibration that tunes your being to the cosmic harmony. Of all outer rituals and sacrifices, this inner, silent sacrifice is the highest. It is a path that leads directly to the experience of the divine within.
