### Osho’s Commentary
Now I shall speak of that which is worth knowing. And why is it worth knowing? Because knowing it, you attain amritam, immortality.
All our seeking is a search for an escape from death. All our philosophies are born of this one fear. But death cannot be escaped; it can only be transcended. And it is transcended by knowing that which was never born and can never die.
And what is the nature of this supreme reality, this Brahman? It is neither being (sat) nor non-being (asat).
Our language is a language of duality. We can only say something is or it is not. But the ultimate reality is beyond both. To say it "is" is to make it a thing, to limit it. To say it "is not" is to deny it completely. It both is and is not, and it is beyond both. It is a great mystery that can only be described by paradoxes. Language fails here. Only a silent, experiential knowing can grasp it.
