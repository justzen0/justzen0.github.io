### Osho’s Commentary
It is not just that these qualities arise from Me. Krishna says, “Even those who have known the truth—the seven great sages, the ancient Manus—they too are born of my will, they are expressions of my being. All of creation is born from them.”
Those who know, and those who do not know; those who are awake, and those who are asleep; those who are in darkness and those who are in light—all arise from the same source. This is the ultimate vision of non-duality. The sage and the sinner are not two. They are two expressions of the same one.
To know this is to drop all judgment. For how can you judge? How can you condemn? This vision of ultimate oneness is the foundation of compassion.
