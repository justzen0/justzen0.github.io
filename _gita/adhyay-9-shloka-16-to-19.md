### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now makes a series of breathtaking, cosmic declarations. He is revealing himself not as a person, but as the total reality.
He says, “I am everything.” The ritual and the sacrifice, the sacred words of the Vedas, the fire and the offering—all are me.
“I am the father, the mother, the grandfather.” He is not just a distant patriarch. He is the entire lineage of existence. The mother who gives birth, the father who sustains, and the ultimate source from which they both come.
He is the goal and the path. The witness and the abode. The refuge and the intimate friend. He is the origin and the dissolution, the imperishable seed from which all of life sprouts.
And then, the ultimate paradoxes. “I am immortality and I am death.” The mind wants to separate these. We see life as good and death as evil. But for Krishna, they are two faces of the same reality. Life finds its culmination in death; death is the gateway to a new life. They are a single, rhythmic dance.
“I am being (sat) and non-being (asat).” I am that which is, and I am also that which is not. This is the deepest mystery. Existence and the void are not two different things. They are like two shores of the same river. The form and the formless, the manifest and the unmanifest—both are contained within me.
This is not a philosophy to be understood; it is a vision to be seen. It is to see the one, undivided reality playing in all these myriad forms and their opposites.
