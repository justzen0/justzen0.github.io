### Osho’s Commentary
Now the narration shifts. Sanjaya, the one with the gift of clairvoyance, is describing the scene to the blind king Dhritarashtra.
The event is happening between Krishna and Arjuna. Sanjaya is a third party, a distant observer. And Dhritarashtra is even more distant, listening to a report. The Gita is a four-layered reality. The experience is Arjuna’s. The vision is Krishna’s. The narration is Sanjaya’s. And the blind listening is Dhritarashtra’s. We are all Dhritarashtras, blind, listening to a story of a light we have not seen.
Sanjaya describes the form: many mouths, many eyes, full of wonder, adorned with divine ornaments and weapons. A cosmic, all-encompassing form.
The human mind is accustomed to seeing beauty in proportion, in limitation. The divine form is beyond all proportion. It is an explosion of infinite possibilities. It is the vision of God not as a beautiful, harmonious being, but as a terrifying, chaotic, all-inclusive reality.
