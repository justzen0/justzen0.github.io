### Osho’s Commentary
This is a final, concluding, and very esoteric shloka. Krishna says that those who know him as the reality underlying all three planes of existence—the material (adhibhuta), the divine (adhidaiva), and the sacrificial (adhiyajna)—they know him even at the moment of death.
To know him in this total way means to see the divine presence not just in the temple, but in the marketplace; not just in the saint, but in the sinner; not just in moments of prayer, but in every ordinary act of life.
For one who has lived with such a total vision, whose mind is constantly yoked to the divine, even the great challenge of death cannot disturb his consciousness. He passes from this world to the other with full awareness, his mind steadfastly fixed on the supreme reality. For him, death is not an end, but a gateway to a larger life.
















Of course. Here is the eighth chapter of Gita Darshan, with each shloka and its commentary summarized in the voice of Osho.
