### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now speaks of the three kinds of giving.
The sattvic gift is given with the simple feeling that it is one's duty. It is given to a worthy person, at the right time and place, and to one who can do nothing in return. It is a pure, unconditional sharing.
The rajasic gift is given with an expectation of a return, whether it be wealth, fame, or favor. It is given grudgingly. It is a business transaction, not a true gift.
And the tamasic gift is given at the wrong time and place, to an unworthy person, without respect, and with contempt. It is not an act of giving, but a way of insulting, of humiliating the other.
The art of giving is a great spiritual art. To give with wisdom, with love, and with no expectation of return is to participate in the boundless generosity of existence itself.
