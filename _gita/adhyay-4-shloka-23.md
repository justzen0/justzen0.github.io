> The liberated person, who has rid themselves of attachment and whose mind is fixed in knowledge, has their actions undertaken for a sacrifice completely destroyed.

### Osho’s Commentary
For such a man—free from attachment, liberated, with a mind rooted in wisdom—who acts only for the sake of yajna, of sacrifice, his whole action dissolves completely, samagram praviliyate.
What does this mean? It means his action leaves no karmic residue. It creates no chain for the future. It is a complete act, finished in the moment it is performed. It does not linger as a memory in his mind, nor does it create a seed for a future reaction.
His action is like a bird flying through the sky. It leaves no footprints. It is pure, total, and complete in itself. The action happens and then disappears into the void, leaving the actor as pure and untouched as he was before.
