> Neither the sun nor the moon nor fire illuminates That. That is My supreme Abode, to which they do not return.

### Osho’s Commentary
And what is this supreme abode like? The sun cannot illumine it, nor the moon, nor the fire.
Why? Because it is light itself. To see me, you need light. But to know that you are, do you need a lamp? This inner feeling of existence, this am-ness, is self-luminous. It needs no external light. Your innermost being is swayam-prakash, self-illuminated.
That supreme reality is the ultimate light of consciousness. All other lights—the sun, the stars—are just pale reflections. That is my supreme abode, says Krishna. And one who reaches there never returns. Why would one return? When you have found the ultimate ocean of bliss, who would want to come back to this world of thirsty deserts? This is the point of no return.
