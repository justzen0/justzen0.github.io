### Osho’s Commentary
What are these devas, these gods? This is not about the mythological gods in heaven. The word deva means a shining one, a divine force, a disembodied consciousness.
The universe is not empty. It is filled with energies, with consciousnesses. There are beings who have lived virtuous lives and now exist on a subtler plane, waiting for the right opportunity to be reborn. There are also beings who have lived evil lives, who also exist on a subtler plane.
When you perform a good action, a selfless action, a Yajna, you create a resonance. You attract these positive, divine forces. They become your allies. Their energy flows to you, and your energy flows to them. A mutual cherishing happens. You are not alone in your goodness. The entire existence supports the one who is in tune with it.
Similarly, when you perform an evil act, you attract dark forces. A murderer is not alone when he commits murder. He becomes a vehicle for all the accumulated energies of violence that are floating in the atmosphere. He feels a superhuman strength, not his own.
Krishna is telling Arjuna, “When you act as a sacrifice, you become a collaborator with the divine forces. You nourish them, and they nourish you.” This is a beautiful symbiotic relationship. In this mutual dance, you attain the supreme good. You are not fighting against existence; you are flowing with it. And in that flow is ultimate victory, ultimate bliss.
