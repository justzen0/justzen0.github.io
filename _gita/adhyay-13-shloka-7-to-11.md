### Osho’s Commentary
Having defined the field, Krishna now describes the qualities of the true knower. This is not a list of virtues to be practiced. This is a description of the fragrance that naturally arises from one who has begun to know.
Amanitvam, humility. Not the practiced humility of a politician, but the natural innocence of one who has seen his own nothingness before the vastness of existence.
Adambhitvam, unpretentiousness. The absence of the desire to prove anything to anyone. A simple, authentic being.
Ahimsa, non-violence. When you realize the one Self in all, how can you be violent? To hurt another is to hurt yourself.
Samachittatvam, equanimity. The quality of a silent mirror that reflects all—the desirable and the undesirable—without being disturbed. It is the fruit of witnessing.
Bhakti, unswerving devotion to Me. A love for the whole, for the ultimate, that is so total there is no room for any other.
Vivikta-desha-sevitvam, a love for solitude. Not because you hate people, but because you have found a joy within that is so profound, the noise of the marketplace becomes a disturbance.
This whole bouquet of qualities, says Krishna, is what I call knowledge. It is a state of being, a transformation of your inner world. All else, all that is opposite to this, is ignorance.
