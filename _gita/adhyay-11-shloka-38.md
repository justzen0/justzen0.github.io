> You are the primal Deity, the ancient Person; You are the supreme Refuge of this world. You are the knower and the object of knowledge, and the supreme Abode. O You of infinite forms, You pervade the Universe!

### Osho’s Commentary
You are the first God, the ancient being, the ultimate home of the universe. You are the knower and the known.
This is the final dissolution of duality. In the ultimate state, the observer and the observed become one. The one who sees and that which is seen merge into a single reality.
And you are the supreme abode. The journey of the soul is a journey back home. We are all wanderers, seeking the place of ultimate rest. That place is not outside; it is the divine reality which is our own deepest nature.
