### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna asks a very practical question: What are the signs of a man who has gone beyond the gunas? How does he live? And how can one cross over them?
Krishna gives the answer. The man who has transcended is one who has become a pure witness.
He does not hate the light of sattva, the activity of rajas, or the delusion of tamas when they arise. Nor does he crave for them when they are absent. He is simply a watcher. He is seated as one who is indifferent, udasinavad. He is not moved by the play of the gunas. He knows that it is just the gunas acting upon the gunas, and he remains steady, unmoved.
This is the state of a man who has found his center. He is no longer identified with the waves on the surface of the ocean. He has become the silent depths. The waves of the gunas come and go, but he remains untouched in his profound stillness.
