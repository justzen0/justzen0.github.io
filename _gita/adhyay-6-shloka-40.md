### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna’s answer is full of immense reassurance. He says, “For such a person, there is no destruction, neither here nor hereafter.”
No effort on the path of truth is ever wasted. Every step taken towards the light is recorded in the cosmic memory. Even if you fail in this life, the good that you have done, the consciousness that you have evolved, will become the foundation for your next life.
No one who does good ever comes to a bad end. This is a fundamental law of existence. The cosmos is not indifferent; it is a supportive, nurturing reality. Every sincere effort is rewarded. There is no need to fear.
