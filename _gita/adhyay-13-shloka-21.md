### Osho’s Commentary
The spirit, dwelling in nature, experiences the qualities of nature. And its attachment to these qualities is the cause of its birth in good and evil wombs.
The bondage is not in the experience, but in the attachment. To see the world is not the problem. But to get attached to what you see, to say, "I must have this," or "I must avoid that"—this is the cause of the whole cycle of birth and death.
Your attachments, your deep-seated desires and aversions, create the blueprint for your next life. You are the creator of your own destiny, your own prison or your own freedom. The key is to experience the world without clinging, to be in the world but not of it.
