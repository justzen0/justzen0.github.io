### Osho’s Commentary
It is undivided, yet it appears as if divided. The electricity is one, but it shines in a million different bulbs. The ocean is one, but it appears as a million different waves. So too, the ultimate reality is one, but it manifests in countless forms. To see the one in the many is wisdom.
It is the supporter of all beings. It is also the devourer and the creator. Here again is the totality of the divine. It is not just the gentle creator, Brahma. It is also the fierce devourer, Shiva. Life and death, creation and destruction, are not two opposing forces. They are the in-breath and the out-breath of the one, absolute reality. To embrace this totality is to be free from all fear.
