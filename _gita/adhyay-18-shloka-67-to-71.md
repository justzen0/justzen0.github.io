### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now gives the conditions for the transmission of this supreme secret.
Do not speak this to one who is not austere, who is not devoted, who is unwilling to listen, or who finds fault with me. This knowledge is not for the profane. It is a sacred trust, to be shared only with those who are worthy, whose hearts are open and receptive.
But he who shares this supreme secret with my devotees, showing the highest love for me, he too will come to me. There is no one who does a more loving service to me than he.
And he who studies this sacred dialogue of ours, by him I shall be worshipped through the sacrifice of knowledge.
And even the man who listens to it with faith and without fault-finding, he too, being liberated, shall attain to the happy worlds of the righteous.
The transmission of truth is a sacred act. It requires a worthy teacher and a worthy disciple. The words of the Gita are not for idle curiosity. They are for those who are on a deep quest, whose hearts are filled with love and a thirst for the ultimate.
