All of them are knowers of the sacrifice and have their sins destroyed by the sacrifice.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now speaks of the many forms of yajna, of sacrifice. He is showing that the path to the divine is not a narrow, single lane. It is a vast landscape with many paths.
Some worship the gods through ritual and offering. This is the path of the devotee.
Some offer the sacrifice itself into the fire of Brahman. This is the path of the wise, the jnani, who sees the divine in all.
Some offer their senses—hearing, sight, touch—into the fire of self-control. This is the path of the ascetic.
Some offer the objects of the senses—sound, form, sensation—into the fire of the senses, enjoying them but remaining unattached. This is the path of the Tantric.
Some offer all the functions of their senses and their life-breath into the fire of the yoga of self-control, kindled by knowledge.
Some offer their wealth, some their austerities, some their study of scriptures. Some offer their very breath, practicing pranayama, the control of life-force.
Do you see the variety? All these are different doors to the same temple. The form of the sacrifice is not what is essential. What is essential is the spirit of offering, the act of letting go of the ego. Whether you offer your wealth, your senses, your breath, or your knowledge, the real offering is always the ‘I’. When the ‘I’ is offered into the fire, whatever path you walk becomes the path to God.
