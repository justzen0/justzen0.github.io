> The Blessed Lord said, "The Immutable is the supreme Brahman; selfhood is said to be the entity present in the individual plane. By action is meant the offerings that bring about the origin of existence of things."

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna answers, and his words are like sutras, seeds of immense meaning.
He says, "The imperishable, the supreme, is Brahman." Aksharam—that which is never destroyed. But look around you, Arjuna. Here, everything that is born, dies. Life is just a short preface to death. The flower that blooms in the morning is gone by the evening. Here, to be is the preparation for not-to-be.
So where is this imperishable Brahman? Your senses can only grasp that which changes, that which is perishable. They cannot touch the eternal. The truth is, only the form is ever destroyed, never the content. Water becomes steam, steam becomes a cloud, the cloud becomes rain, and the rain becomes water again. The forms change, but the essence, the water, remains. Science has now stumbled upon this very truth—that nothing is ever destroyed. But Krishna knew it five thousand years ago. The formless essence is Brahman.
And what is Adhyatma? "Its essential nature"—Swabhavo'dhyatmam uchyate. It is your swabhava, your own intrinsic nature. Not what you have learned, not the language you speak, not the body you wear. These are all borrowed clothes. Your true nature is that which remains when all clothes are removed, when all conditioning is dropped. It is the silent, formless consciousness within.
And Karma? It is not a ritual in a temple. Krishna says it is the visarga, the great offering, the great sacrifice that brings beings into existence. This is a very profound secret. Karma is the act of losing your being in the act of becoming something else. It is the great tragedy of sacrificing the diamond of your soul for a handful of colored pebbles in the marketplace. This falling away from your own center is Karma.
