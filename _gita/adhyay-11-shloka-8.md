### Osho’s Commentary
“But,” says Krishna, “you cannot see me with these physical eyes.”
These eyes can only see matter. They can only see that which is gross. The divine is subtle; it cannot be perceived by the senses. For that, a new sense is needed, a new kind of seeing.
“I give you a divine eye,” says Krishna. This is not something that can be surgically implanted. This is a transformation of consciousness. When a master like Krishna says, “I give you this eye,” it is a catalytic act. The disciple, in his total surrender, becomes open. The master’s presence, his energy, acts as a catalyst, and a dormant potential within the disciple is awakened.
The third eye is not a fantasy. It is a reality. It is the eye of pure consciousness, which can see without the medium of the physical senses. When this eye opens, the world of duality disappears, and the one, undivided reality is revealed. Krishna is offering Arjuna not just a vision, but a new way of seeing.
