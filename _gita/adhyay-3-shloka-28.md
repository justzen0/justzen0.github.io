> But, O mighty-armed one, the one who is a knower of the facts about the varieties of the gunas and actions does not become attached, thinking thus: 'The organs act on the objects of the organs.'

### Osho’s Commentary
The one who knows the truth, the tattvavit, understands the mechanics of existence. He sees that it is just the gunas, the qualities of nature, interacting with each other.
The beauty of a flower acts upon the quality of sight in the eyes. The sweetness of a fruit acts upon the quality of taste on the tongue. It is a play of energies, of qualities. The Self, the real “I”, is not involved. It is a witness to this play.
Knowing this, he is not attached, na sajjate. How can he be attached? Attachment arises only when you think, “I am the one who is enjoying, I am the one who is suffering.” When you see that it is just an impersonal play of forces, the basis for attachment dissolves.
You are the screen on which the movie is projected. The movie may be a tragedy or a comedy. The screen remains unaffected. The wise man knows that he is the screen, the pure consciousness. The play of life happens upon him, but does not touch him.
