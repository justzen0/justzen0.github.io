### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna’s vision is all-encompassing. He claims not just the positive aspects of life, but also the seemingly negative.
“I am the all-devouring death.” And "I am the gambling of the cheats." What does this mean? It means that even in the darkest corners of existence, the divine energy is present, though perhaps in a distorted or perverted form. To see God only in the good is a partial vision. The true vision is to see the one reality playing in all its forms, light and dark. Life is a great gamble, a great game of chance. And even in this game, the divine is present.
Among women, he lists seven great qualities: fame, prosperity, beautiful speech, memory, intelligence, steadfastness, and forgiveness. These represent the highest flowering of the feminine principle.
Of the Pandavas, he says, “I am Dhananjaya”—another name for Arjuna himself. This is the most intimate and direct pointer. After taking Arjuna on a grand tour of the cosmos, he brings him back to himself. He is saying, “If you want to see me in the Pandavas, look no further. Look within your own self.”
And of all secrets, “I am the silence.” Speech can reveal, but silence can reveal even more. The ultimate truths cannot be spoken; they can only be experienced in a deep, inner silence.
And finally, “I am the knowledge of the knowers.” Not just knowledge as information, but the very faculty of knowing, the pure consciousness that is the source of all knowledge. This is the ultimate, the tattva-jnana.
