### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna tries to lift Arjuna to the timeless, but Arjuna immediately falls back into the trap of time. He asks a question of the mind, a question of logic. “You were born just now, Krishna. The sun is ancient. How can you have taught him?”
This is the barrier. Arjuna is seeing the body, the container, and missing the content completely. He is looking at the wave and forgetting the ocean. Krishna is speaking from the consciousness of the ocean, and Arjuna is hearing from the standpoint of a tiny, mortal wave. How can there be a dialogue?
This question is not born of a true seeking. It is born of doubt. It is the intellect raising a wall. “How can I believe this?” And where there is a question of belief, love is absent. Love believes without asking how. Love is an instant trust. Arjuna’s question shows that the intimacy Krishna was speaking of has not yet happened. He is still a stranger, calculating, measuring, trying to fit the infinite into his small, logical frame.
