### Osho’s Commentary
By his very previous practice, he is carried forward, even helplessly.
The momentum of the past life’s sadhana is so powerful that it pulls him towards the spiritual path in the new life, sometimes even against his conscious will. He may find himself inexplicably drawn to meditation, to saints, to scriptures.
And even a mere inquirer into yoga—one who has just a little curiosity—goes beyond the realm of mere ritual, the shabdabrahma, the world of sacred words.
Even a small step on the path of yoga has a tremendous transformative power. It sets in motion a process that will continue over many lives, until the final goal is reached.
