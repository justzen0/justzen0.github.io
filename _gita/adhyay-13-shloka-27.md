### Osho’s Commentary
He alone sees who sees the supreme Lord dwelling equally in all beings. Who sees the imperishable in the midst of the perishing.
The outer forms are all perishable. Your body will die, the tree will die, the star will die. But within every perishable form dwells the imperishable reality, the one supreme Self.
To see this one in all, to go beyond the outer differences of name and form and to perceive the underlying unity—this is true vision. The one who has this vision lives in a world of love, of equality, of peace.
