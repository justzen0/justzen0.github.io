### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna expresses the doubt of every seeker. The goal is beautiful, but the mind is so restless, so difficult to control. It seems as difficult as trying to control the wind.
This is not a philosophical argument; it is an existential cry. This is the experience of every man who has tried to look within. The mind is a mad monkey, constantly jumping from one branch to another.
Arjuna’s comparison is perfect. The mind is like the wind—invisible, powerful, and ever-moving. But in this very simile, there is a misunderstanding. The wind is a substance, a part of the material world. The mind is not. The mind is a process, a relationship between the soul and the body. And a relationship can be changed. An attachment can be broken. The mind is not a thing to be controlled, but a pattern to be understood.
