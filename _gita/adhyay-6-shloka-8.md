> One whose mind is satisfied with knowledge and realization, who is unmoved, who has his organs under control, is said to be Self-absorbed. The yogi treats all alike, a lump of earth, a stone, and gold.

### Osho’s Commentary
Who is this true yogi? He is one who is satisfied with jnana and vijnana—knowledge and wisdom. Jnana is knowing the self; vijnana is knowing the other, the world.
To be satisfied with knowledge means that all curiosity has ceased. The childish mind is always asking, “Why?” The mature mind simply sees, “This is.” It accepts existence as it is. When this deep acceptance happens, all questions dissolve.
Such a person is kutastho—firm as an anvil. You can hammer on it, but it remains unshaken. He is established in his center.
He has conquered his senses. And for him, a clod of earth, a stone, and a piece of gold are all the same. Why? Because the value we give to things is just a projection of our own desire. When desire is gone, all values disappear. Things are seen in their naked reality, without our labels. Such a man is a true yogi.
