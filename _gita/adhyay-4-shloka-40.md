> One who is ignorant and faithless, and has a doubting mind, perishes. Neither this world nor the next, nor happiness, exists for one who has a doubting mind.

### Osho’s Commentary
And now, the other side. The ignorant man, the man without trust, and the man whose very soul is doubt, sanshayatma, he perishes.
His perishing is not physical death. It is a spiritual death. He lives in a hell of his own making. The doubting mind can never be at peace. It is a constant state of wavering, of conflict, of indecision.
For such a man, there is no joy in this world, because he can never commit himself totally to anything. He cannot love, he cannot celebrate. And there is no possibility of the other world, because the door to the other world opens only through trust. He has no happiness here or hereafter.
Doubt is a disease of the soul. Faith—not belief, but the innocent trust of an open heart—is the only medicine.
