### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna again emphasizes that desire, kama, is the eternal enemy of the wise.
Why the enemy of the wise? Because the ignorant man doesn't even know he is in bondage. He takes his desires to be his own. He identifies with them completely. Only the wise man, the one who has had a glimpse of his own inner freedom, sees desire as an enemy, as a fetter.
And this desire is kamarupena, it can take any form. Today it is for money, tomorrow for power, the day after for fame. It is a chameleon, constantly changing its color.
And it is dushpurena, difficult to satisfy. It is analena, an insatiable fire. The more you feed it, the more it burns. It is a thirst that can never be quenched.
The only way to be free from this fire is not by trying to satisfy it—that is impossible—but by turning your attention inwards, by finding the source of bliss within yourself. When you have found the inner ocean, the thirst of desire simply disappears.
