### Osho’s Commentary
And finally, Krishna declares his ultimate nature. “I am the abode of Brahman.” I am the home of the absolute, the immortal, the eternal law, and the ultimate bliss.
He is not speaking as a person. He is speaking as the supreme reality itself. He is the source and the goal of all existence.
To take refuge in him is to take refuge in the ultimate reality. To love him is to love the whole. And in that love, in that surrender, you find your own true nature, which is also immortal, eternal, and blissful. The journey ends where it began—in the heart of the divine.
