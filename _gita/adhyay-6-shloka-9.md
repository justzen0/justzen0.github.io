### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now speaks of the highest form of equanimity—not just towards pleasure and pain, but towards all kinds of people. From the friend to the enemy, the saint to the sinner, the yogi sees with an equal eye.
How is this possible? Our whole mind is based on these distinctions. This is my friend; that is my enemy.
The secret is what the sages call sakhya—to see with the heart of a friend, to stand in the other’s shoes. The moment you see the world from another’s perspective, your own ego begins to dissolve. You see that the same life force, the same consciousness, is playing in all forms. The sinner and the saint are just two roles in the great divine drama.
When you can look at your enemy and see yourself, when you can look at yourself and see your enemy, you have achieved samabuddhi, the equal vision. This is the ultimate test of a yogi. He has gone beyond all judgments and sees the one divine reality in every being.
