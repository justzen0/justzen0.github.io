### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna says, “Many before you have walked this path.” He who is free from attachment (vita-raga), fear (bhaya), and anger (krodha). These three are the pillars of the ego. When they fall, the ego collapses.
“Absorbed in me, taking refuge in me”—manmaya mamupashritah. This is the state of surrender. When the ego is gone, what remains? A pure emptiness. Into this emptiness, the divine can flow. To be absorbed in Krishna is to be absorbed in the whole. To take refuge in him is to relax into existence.
“Purified by the fire of knowledge”—jnanatapasa puta. Knowledge is a fire. It does not add anything to you; it only burns away the dross, the impurities, the ignorance. What remains after this fire is your pure gold, your essential being. And those, says Krishna, “have attained my state of being”—madbhavam agatah. They have become one with me. They have become Krishnas themselves.
