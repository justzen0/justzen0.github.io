### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna is trembling, his voice choked with fear and awe. He is completely overwhelmed.

This trembling is not just of fear; it is also a sign of a great inner transformation. It is the trembling of a seed that is about to break open, of an old self that is dying to give birth to a new one.
