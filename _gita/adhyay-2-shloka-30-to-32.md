### Osho’s Commentary
The Self in all bodies is eternal and indestructible. Therefore, do not grieve.
And also, considering your own swadharma, your own nature, you should not waver. For a Kshatriya, a warrior, there is nothing more righteous than a just war. Fortunate are those who get such an opportunity, which comes as an open door to heaven.
Krishna is now bringing the highest metaphysics down to the most practical level. He is telling Arjuna not just what is the ultimate truth, but what is his truth, what is his path of action.
Your swadharma is the unique path through which your soul can find its fulfillment. For Arjuna, the warrior, the battlefield is the ultimate challenge, the ultimate opportunity for him to realize his own potential, to reach his peak. To run away from it would be to betray his own being.
