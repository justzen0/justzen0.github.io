### Osho’s Commentary
To those who are ever-steadfast, worshipping me with love, I give that buddhi-yoga, that yoga of understanding, by which they come to me.
And what is this buddhi-yoga? It is not the intellect that we know. Our intellect is a reflection, a borrowed light. It is like the mind of a blind man who can talk about light but has never seen it. The true buddhi is an inner vision, a direct perception. It is the lamp of knowledge.
And out of compassion, says Krishna, I myself, dwelling in their own hearts, destroy the darkness of their ignorance with this shining lamp.
The darkness is not a positive entity. It is just the absence of light. You do not have to fight it. You just have to bring the lamp. And the moment the lamp is lit, the darkness of a thousand years disappears.
Our ignorance is ancient. But a single moment of enlightenment is enough to dispel it. And this lamp is not to be borrowed. It has to be lit within your own being. When the master says, “I give you this yoga of understanding,” he is not giving you a thing. He is giving you a fire, a spark, which can kindle the lamp that is already within you. The oil is there, the wick is there. Only the flame is missing. The master is one who has the flame. And he can share it with all who are ready to receive.
