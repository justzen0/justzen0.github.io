### Osho’s Commentary
And Krishna says, “Behold!”
What has Arjuna done to deserve this? In the world of spirituality, earning comes through letting go. Arjuna has let go of his doubt, his questions. He has arrived at a point where he says, “Whatever you say is so.” In this moment of total acceptance, he has earned the vision.
Do not think that Krishna was waiting, holding back. Krishna is always available. We are not. Our minds are full of questions, of arguments. The moment the mind becomes silent, a mirror, the divine is reflected.
And Krishna says, “See now in my body the entire universe.” All the gods, all the wonders, all of creation, moving and unmoving, established in one single spot.
A profound secret is being hinted at. We think of man as a small part of the universe. But the mystics have always known that the whole universe is contained within man. You are a microcosm. The entire cosmos is reflected in you. To know yourself is to know all. Krishna is offering Arjuna a glimpse into this inner cosmos, a journey not into outer space, but into the infinite space within.
