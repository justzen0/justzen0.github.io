> O Partha, know Me to be the eternal seed of all beings. I am the intellect of the intelligent, and I am the courage of the courageous.<br><br>And of the strong, I am the strength that is devoid of passion and attachment. Among creatures, I am desire that is not contrary to righteousness, O scion of the Bharata dynasty.

### Osho’s Commentary
“I am the eternal seed of all beings.” The cause of all causes, the ultimate source.
“I am the intelligence of the intelligent.” He is not talking about intellect, about cleverness. He is talking about buddhi, wisdom. Intellect is borrowed knowledge, a collection of information. It makes the mind smaller, like a room filled with furniture. Wisdom is an empty space, a clarity, a mirror that reflects reality. It is an inner awakening.
“I am the strength of the strong, free from desire.” The strength that comes from desire is a kind of madness. A man in a rage can perform superhuman feats, but it is an unconscious force. The strength of a Mahavira, who endures all suffering with a silent smile, is born of consciousness. It is a strength free from the fever of desire.
“And I am the desire that is not against dharma.” This is a revolutionary statement. When a man is filled with dharma, with a sense of cosmic order, his very sexuality is transformed. It is no longer a blind, unconscious urge. It becomes a conscious act, a sacred ritual. When the energy of sex is guided by the light of awareness, it becomes a doorway to the divine.
