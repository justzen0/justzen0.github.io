> Under Me as the supervisor, the Prakrti produces the world of the moving and the non-moving things. Owing to this, O son of Kunti, the world revolves.<br><br>Not knowing My supreme nature as the Lord of all beings, foolish people disregard Me, who have taken a human form.<br><br>Possessed of vain hopes, vain actions, vain knowledge, and senselessness, they become verily possessed of the deceptive disposition of fiends and demons.

### Osho’s Commentary
My presence is enough. I am the great supervisor, the catalytic agent. In my presence, nature gives birth to this whole universe. This is a very scientific statement. A catalyst is a substance that, by its mere presence, causes a chemical reaction, but it does not participate in it. It remains unchanged. The divine is such a presence. Its being is enough for creation to happen.
But the deluded, the foolish, they disregard me when they see me in a human form. They cannot see beyond the body. They see the man, but miss the god. They see the wave, but miss the ocean.
And who are these fools? They are people of vain hopes, vain actions, and vain knowledge.
Vain hope is to seek the permanent in the impermanent. To hope for happiness from the other.
Vain action is action born of the ego. Action that creates more bondage, more misery.
Vain knowledge is knowledge that is borrowed, that is not an experience. It is a burden, not a liberation.
Such people, says Krishna, fall into a demonic nature. They are trapped in illusion, in darkness. The door to the divine is open, but their eyes are closed. They see the form, but they are blind to the formless reality that shines through it.
