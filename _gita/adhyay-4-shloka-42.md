### Osho’s Commentary
And finally, Krishna brings it all back to Arjuna, to the battlefield. “Therefore, Arjuna, with the sword of knowledge, cut this doubt in your heart.”
This doubt, this wavering, is born of ignorance. It is the shadow of the ego. The sword that can cut it is not of steel, but of knowledge, of self-knowing.
“Take refuge in yoga,” he says. Yoga means union, balance, skill in action. Become centered, become balanced. And then, uttishtha Bharata, stand up, O Arjuna!
This is the whole message of the Gita in a nutshell. Don't run away from life. Don't escape from the battlefield. Awaken your inner knowledge, find your center, and then stand up and face your life, your duty, your dharma, with the courage and grace of an awakened one. Action performed from that centeredness is liberation itself.
