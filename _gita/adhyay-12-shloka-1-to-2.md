### Osho’s Commentary
The door to love, my friend, the entry into devotion, opens onto a strange journey. There is a world that the mind can grasp, a world of logic and reason. But there is another dimension where logic fails, where the mind finds the doors closed. There, only the heart can enter. In that strange land, to be blind to the intellect is to have true eyes, and to be a fool to reason is to be truly intelligent.
A Sufi mystic, Bayazid, tells of a bird that flew into a room through an open window. The room was closed from all other sides. The bird, in a panic, started beating its wings against the closed walls, the closed doors, the ceiling. It exhausted itself, flying in every direction, but it never tried the one window through which it had entered.
We are that bird. We enter this world through the door of Love. Love is the origin. And yet, when we seek a way out, we beat our heads against the walls of reason, logic, and philosophy. We never look back to the very door through which we came.
Devotion, my friend, is not a new path. It is the same river of love, simply turned around. When the river of love flows outward towards the world, it is attachment, it is bondage. When the same river turns and flows inward, it becomes devotion, it becomes liberation. It is the same energy, just a change of direction.
Arjuna stands at this turning point. He sees two paths: one of the formless, the path of knowing; and one of the form, the path of loving. And he asks Krishna, “Which is superior?”
And Krishna’s answer is for Arjuna, for a man whose very being is receptive to love. He says, “Those who fix their minds on me, who worship me with supreme faith, they are the most perfect in yoga.” For Arjuna, a man of the heart, the path of love is the supreme path.
