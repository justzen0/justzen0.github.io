### Osho’s Commentary
Now Krishna gives an example. He mentions Janaka, the great king who was also a fully realized soul. Janaka lived in a palace, ruled a kingdom, yet he was completely unattached, a true sannyasin in the marketplace. He attained perfection through action alone.
Krishna is breaking the myth that one must renounce the world to find God. He is saying that the world is the very field where liberation can be found.
Then he adds another reason for action: lokasangraha, the welfare of the world. He is telling Arjuna, “You are a leader. People look up to you. Whatever you do, others will imitate. If you, a great warrior, run away from your duty, you will set a wrong example. You will create chaos. For the sake of holding the world together, for the good of all, you must act.”
An enlightened man may have no personal need to act, but he continues to act out of compassion for the world. He acts so that others may be guided, so that the social fabric is not torn apart. His action becomes a teaching, a guiding light for those who are still in darkness.
