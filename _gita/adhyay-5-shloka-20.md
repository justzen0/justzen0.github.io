> A knower of Brahman, who is established in Brahman, should have their intellect steady and should not be deluded. They should not get delighted by getting what is desirable, nor become dejected by getting what is undesirable.

### Osho’s Commentary
Such a person, the knower of Brahman, is not tossed about by the waves of life.
He does not rejoice when something pleasant comes his way, nor does he become agitated when something unpleasant happens. His intellect is steady, sthirabuddhi, and he is unbewildered, asammudho.
Why? Because he knows that both pleasure and pain are fleeting appearances on the surface of his being. His real nature, the Self, is untouched by them. He has found the still point within, the center of the cyclone, where there is only silence and peace. He is established in the eternal, beyond the passing show of worldly joys and sorrows.
