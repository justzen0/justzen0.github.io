> May you have no fear, and may there be no bewilderment upon seeing this form of Mine so terrible. Becoming free from fear and gladdened in mind once again, behold this earlier form of Mine.

### Osho’s Commentary
Do not be afraid, do not be bewildered. Be free from fear, and with a happy heart, see my other form again.
Krishna is full of compassion. He understands the terror that his cosmic form has evoked in Arjuna. And so, he gently leads him back from the terrifying vision of the infinite to the comforting presence of the personal God.
This is the beauty of the path of devotion. The divine meets you where you are. It does not force upon you a reality that you are not yet ready to bear. It gently guides you, step by step, from the known to the unknown, from the form to the formless.
