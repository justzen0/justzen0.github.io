### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna places the chariot right in the heart of the battlefield, between the two armies. And there, Arjuna sees. What does he see? Not enemies, but his own people. Fathers, grandfathers, teachers, uncles, sons, grandsons, friends.
The whole of life is a network of relationships. We are not islands. Our very identity is woven from these threads of connection. To cut these threads is to cut a part of oneself.
The man of violence lives in a world of abstractions. He talks of ‘the enemy’. But when you are forced to see the individual faces—the old teacher Drona, who taught you how to hold a bow; the grandsire Bhishma, who held you on his lap as a child—then the abstraction disappears. The ‘enemy’ becomes a beloved.
And in that moment of seeing, a great compassion arises in Arjuna’s heart. He is not a man of stone. He is a man of feeling, of love. And for such a man, this war is not just a political conflict. It is a deep, personal tragedy. It is the tearing apart of his own heart. This is the beginning of his vishad, his sorrow.
