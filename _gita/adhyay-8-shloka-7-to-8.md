### Osho’s Commentary
"Therefore, Arjuna, at all times, remember me and fight."
This is the very heart of Krishna's message, the great synthesis. He does not say, "Remember me or fight." He says, "Remember me and fight." He is not teaching an escape from life, but a transformation of life. The remembrance should become the very ground of your action.
It is like a thread in a garland of flowers. The flowers are the actions of life; the thread of remembrance runs through them, holding them together, giving them a new unity, a new beauty. The thread is invisible, but without it, the flowers would be just a scattered heap.
Let your remembrance be so deep that it is not a separate activity. Let it become your very breath. Let your hands be engaged in work, but let your heart be absorbed in the divine. This is the art of turning the marketplace into a temple.
And this is not possible through a divided mind. Your consciousness must be ananya-gamina, not wandering elsewhere. A total, one-pointed love, a deep absorption. This is not just a practice; it is a way of being. When your whole life becomes a stream flowing towards the ocean of the divine, then you will surely reach the supreme.
