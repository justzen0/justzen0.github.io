> Thus having known, even the ancient seekers of liberation performed their duties. Therefore, you should undertake action as was performed earlier by the ancients.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna brings the highest philosophy down to Arjuna’s immediate situation. He says, “Knowing this secret of desireless action, the ancient seekers also acted.”
Liberation is not found in escaping from the world, but in transforming your way of being in the world. Renunciation of action is a misunderstanding. The real path is renunciation in action.
Therefore, he tells Arjuna, “You too must act.” Do not fall into the trap of thinking that knowledge means inaction. True knowledge leads to a new kind of action—an action that is free, spontaneous, and unburdened by the ego. So, pick up your bow, Arjuna. Act, as the wise have always acted. Do not run away from your duty, but perform it with a new consciousness, a new freedom.
