### Osho’s Commentary
Now, the other path, the path of return. It is described with symbols of darkness: smoke (dhuma), night (ratri), the dark fortnight of the moon (krishna), and the six months of the sun’s southern course (dakshinayanam).
These symbolize a consciousness that is moving downwards, towards more unconsciousness.
Dhuma, smoke, is when the fire of life is clouded by desires and attachments.
Ratri, night, is a state of spiritual sleep, of ignorance.
Krishna, the dark fortnight, symbolizes the waning moon, a consciousness that is diminishing, losing its light.
And Dakshinayanam, the southern path, symbolizes the downward flow of life-energy, towards the world, towards bondage.
The yogi who departs in this state of descending darkness goes to a temporary heaven, the "lunar light," enjoys the fruits of his good deeds, and then returns to the earth.
These two paths are eternal. One leads to liberation; the other leads back to the wheel of birth and death. The choice is always yours, in every moment. Are you moving towards the light, or towards the darkness?
