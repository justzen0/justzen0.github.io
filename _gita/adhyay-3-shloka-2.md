### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna says, “Your words are confusing me, Krishna. You seem to be mixing things up. One moment you praise knowledge, the next you praise action. Just tell me one thing, one clear path, so I can be free of this confusion.”
But is it Krishna’s words that are confusing? Or is it Arjuna’s own mind that is a chaos of confusion? A confused mind will find confusion everywhere. A clear mind will find clarity even in contradictions. The world is seen not as it is, but as you are.
Arjuna’s name itself means the wavering one, the indecisive one. He is a symbol of the modern mind—torn, fragmented, unable to take a decisive step. He stands between two paths and wants Krishna to choose for him. But another’s certainty cannot become your own.
Socrates was dying, the cup of poison in his hand. He was so certain, so peaceful. His friends asked him, “How can you be so sure? The atheists say there is no soul, and you will simply be gone. The believers say the soul is immortal. What if the atheists are right?” Socrates smiled and said, “If the atheists are right, and I simply disappear, what is there to worry about? The one who worries will also be gone. And if the believers are right, and the soul is immortal, then what is there to worry about? The soul cannot be harmed.”
Do you see? A man of clarity finds clarity in every possibility. Arjuna, a man of confusion, finds confusion even in the clearest of teachings. He is asking for a doctrine, a dogma, to cling to. But life does not offer dogmas; it offers a mirror. Krishna is a mirror, and in him, Arjuna is only seeing the reflection of his own wavering mind.
