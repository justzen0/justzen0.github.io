> I am impartial towards all beings; to Me there is none detestable or none dear. But those who worship Me with devotion, they exist in Me, and I too exist in them.<br><br>Even if a man of very bad conduct worships Me with single-minded devotion, he is to be considered truly good; for he has rightly resolved.<br><br>He soon becomes possessed of a virtuous mind; he attains everlasting peace. Do you proclaim boldly, O son of Kunti, that My devotee will not be ruined.

### Osho’s Commentary
The divine is like the sun. It shines equally on all—the saint and the sinner, the good and the bad. It has no favorites. But the one who opens his doors, who turns his face towards the sun, is filled with its light. The sun does not choose him; he chooses the sun.
So Krishna says, “I am the same to all. But those who worship me with love, they are in me and I am in them.” A special relationship of intimacy is born. The devotee, by opening his heart, allows the divine to become manifest within him.
And then, a most revolutionary and compassionate statement. Even if the most sinful man turns to me with single-minded devotion, he should be considered a saint. Why? Because he has made the right resolve.
This is a profound insight into the nature of transformation. A single moment of total, heartfelt turning towards the divine can burn away the sins of a million lifetimes. It is not your past actions that define you, but your present state of consciousness, your present resolve.
Such a person, says Krishna, quickly becomes a soul of dharma and attains eternal peace. And then, the ultimate promise: “O Arjuna, know for certain, my devotee is never lost.” A life devoted to the divine cannot go in vain. It is a journey that is guaranteed to reach the ultimate destination.
