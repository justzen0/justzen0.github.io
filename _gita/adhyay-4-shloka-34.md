### Osho’s Commentary
How is this supreme knowledge to be attained? Krishna gives a three-fold path for the disciple.
Pranipatena—By prostration, by surrender. Not just a physical act, but a deep inner bowing down, an emptying of the ego before the master.
Pariprashnena—By questioning. Not out of intellectual curiosity or argumentativeness, but out of a deep thirst to know, a sincere inquiry born of a humble heart.
Sevaya—By service. By being in tune with the master, serving his work, being in his presence with love and receptivity.
When these three qualities are present in a seeker—a surrendered ego, a sincere inquiry, and a loving heart—then the wise, the tattvadarshinah, those who have themselves seen the truth, will impart their wisdom to you. Knowledge cannot be stolen; it cannot be bought. It can only be received when the disciple is in a state of deep grace and openness.
