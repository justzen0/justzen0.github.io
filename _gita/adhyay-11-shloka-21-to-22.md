> Those very groups of gods enter into You; struck with fear, some extol You with joined palms. Groups of great sages and perfected beings praise You with elaborate hymns, saying, 'May it be well!'<br><br>Those who are the Rudras, the Adityas, the Vasus, and the Sadhyas, the Visvedevas, the two Asvins, the Maruts, and the Usmapas, and hosts of Gandharvas, Yaksas, demons, and Siddhas—all of those very ones gaze at You, being indeed struck with wonder.

### Osho’s Commentary
The hosts of gods are entering into that great form. Some, in fear, are praising it. The great sages are singing hymns. All are gazing in wonder.
The vision is now becoming a vision of cosmic dissolution. The individual forms of the gods are disappearing into the one, universal form. It is like rivers merging into the ocean.
This is a vision of the ultimate oneness, but it is a oneness that is achieved through a kind of death, a dissolution of the individual. For the ego, which wants to remain separate, this is a terrifying prospect. But for the soul that is ready to lose itself in the whole, it is the ultimate liberation.
