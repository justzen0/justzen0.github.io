### Osho’s Commentary
The deluded ones do not see this soul, whether it is staying in the body, or experiencing the world, or departing at death. They see only the body. But those with the jnana-chakshu, the eye of knowledge, they see.
The striving yogis perceive this soul dwelling within. But those whose minds are not pure, who are unintelligent, even if they strive, they do not see.
What is this eye of knowledge? It is the eye of pure, silent awareness. It is not something you are born with; it has to be opened through spiritual practice. And the primary condition for it to open is the purification of the heart.
Effort alone is not enough. You can sit for years in a posture, you can repeat a mantra a million times, but if your heart is full of greed, anger, and ego, you will see nothing. The inner mirror must first be cleansed. Only a pure, silent, and loving heart can reflect the ultimate reality.
