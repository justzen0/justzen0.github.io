### Osho’s Commentary
Whatever is born in this universe, whether moving or unmoving, is born from the union of the field and its knower, of Prakriti and Purusha.
This is the cosmic dance of Shiva and Shakti. The spirit and nature are the two fundamental principles of existence. And all of creation is their love play.
The spirit alone cannot create, for it is pure consciousness, without any energy. Nature alone cannot create, for it is blind energy, without any consciousness. Only when these two come together does life become possible. To see this cosmic union in every particle of existence is to see the divine play.
