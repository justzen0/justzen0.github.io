### Osho’s Commentary
A beautiful comparison. The ignorant man acts, and the wise man acts. From the outside, their actions may look the same. But from the inside, there is a world of difference.
The ignorant man, the avidvan, acts with attachment, saktah. He is attached to the result. His ego is deeply involved. He is full of desire, anxiety, fear.
The wise man, the vidvan, also acts, but without attachment, asaktah. He acts with the same totality, the same energy, but he is like an actor on a stage. He plays his part perfectly, but he knows it is just a play. He is a witness to his own actions.
Krishna is not telling Arjuna to act half-heartedly. He is saying, “Act with the same passion, the same intensity as the ignorant man. Pour your whole being into it. But remain a witness inside. Remain detached.”
And why should the wise man act? For lokasangraha, for the welfare of the world. His action is a gift, an offering. It is born not of need, but of overflowing grace.
