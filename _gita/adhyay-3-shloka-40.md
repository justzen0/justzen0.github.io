### Osho’s Commentary
Where does this enemy, desire, reside? Krishna maps out its territory. Its dwelling places are the senses (indriyani), the mind (manas), and the intellect (buddhi).
It operates through these three instruments. The senses bring in the information from the outside world. The mind processes this information with its memories and thoughts. The intellect makes judgments and decisions based on this. And in this whole process, desire finds its home.
Through these three, it deludes the soul, dehinam, the embodied one. It veils the true knowledge, the inner light. The soul becomes identified with the senses, the mind, and the intellect, and forgets its true nature as the pure witness.
The path of liberation is a path of dis-identification from these three. To know that “I am not the senses, I am not the mind, I am not the intellect. I am the pure consciousness that witnesses all three.” This is the beginning of wisdom.
