> The Blessed Lord said, O mighty-armed one, undoubtedly the mind is untamable and restless. But, O son of Kunti, it can be brought under control through practice and detachment.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna does not deny Arjuna’s difficulty. He says, “Without doubt, the mind is difficult to control.” First, the acceptance. This is the compassion of a true master.
But then he gives the key. It can be restrained by two things: abhyasa, constant practice, and vairagya, non-attachment.
What is this practice? It is the constant effort to be aware, to be a witness. To bring the mind back again and again to the present moment. And what is non-attachment? It is the understanding that the world cannot give you ultimate happiness. It is the letting go of the desperate clinging to worldly pleasures.
These are the two wings of the bird of meditation. With these two wings, the mind can be trained to fly inwards towards the bliss of the Self.
