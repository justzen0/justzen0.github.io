### Osho’s Commentary
Thus, the field, knowledge, and the object of knowledge have been told in brief. And my devotee, knowing this, becomes ready for my state of being.
Knowledge is not just information; it is a preparation. It makes you worthy, it makes you a fit vessel. When you have understood this map of reality—what the field is, what the knower is, and what is to be known—then you become ready for the final merger.
And the final key is madbhaktah, my devotee. This ultimate knowing does not come to a dry intellectual, but to a heart that is overflowing with love. Devotion is the alchemy that transforms knowledge into realization.
