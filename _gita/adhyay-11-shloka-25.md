> Having merely seen Your mouths made terrible with their teeth and resembling the fire of Dissolution, I have lost my sense of direction and find no comfort. Be gracious, O Lord of gods, O Abode of the Universe.

### Osho’s Commentary
Now he sees the mouths of God as the fire of the final dissolution, kalanala. In this terror, he has lost all sense of direction. He finds no peace. He cries out, "Have mercy!"
The mind can function only when it has a sense of order, of direction. But this vision is one of pure, chaotic energy. It shatters all the structures of the mind.
This is the state of unknowing. When all your knowledge, all your concepts, are burned away, you are left in a state of pure, terrifying mystery. This is a state that the intellect cannot bear. And so, Arjuna cries out for mercy, for a return to the known, the familiar world.
