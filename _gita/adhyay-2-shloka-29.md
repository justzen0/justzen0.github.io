### Osho’s Commentary
The Self is a great wonder, a marvel. Some see it as a wonder, some speak of it as a wonder, some hear of it as a wonder. But even after hearing, no one truly knows it.
Why? Because the Self is not an object that can be known by the mind. It is not a piece of information. It is an experience. It is a state of being. You can hear about it, you can think about it, but to know it, you must become it.
The path to knowing the Self is not a path of accumulating knowledge, but of dissolving the knower. When the mind is silent, when the ego is no more, then the marvel is revealed—not as something known, but as your own essential nature.
