### Osho’s Commentary
And of all the yogis, who is the highest? He who worships Me with faith, with his whole inner being merged in Me. He is the most united, the most dear to Me.
This is the path of love, of devotion, of bhakti. It is not enough to be just a yogi, practicing techniques. The final step is to bring the quality of love, of faith, of surrender, to your practice.
When your yoga is not just a discipline but a love affair with the divine, when your inner self is completely merged in the divine presence, then you have reached the highest peak. This is the culmination of all yoga.










Of course. Here is the seventh chapter of Gita Darshan, with each shloka and its commentary summarized in the voice of Osho.
