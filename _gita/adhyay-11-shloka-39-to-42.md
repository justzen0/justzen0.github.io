> You are air, death, fire, the god of the waters, the moon, the Lord of creatures, and the great-grandfather. Salutations to you a thousand times! Salutations to you again and again! Salutations!<br><br>Salutations to You in the East and behind. Salutations to You on all sides indeed, O All! You possess infinite strength and infinite heroism. You pervade everything; thus You are all!<br><br>Without knowing Your greatness, whatever I said rashly, inadvertently, or even out of familiarity, thinking You to be a friend, addressing You as 'O Krsna,' 'O Yadava,' 'O friend,' etc.<br><br>And that You have been discourteously treated out of fun—while walking, while on a bed, while on a seat, while eating, in privacy, or, O Acyuta, even in public—for that, I beg pardon of You, the incomprehensible One.

### Osho’s Commentary
After this long and glorious description, Krishna brings it all to a final, magnificent conclusion.
He says, “I am the seed of all beings. Nothing can exist without me.” And my glories are endless. What I have told you is just a brief hint.
And then, a simple key for Arjuna to use in his own life: “Whatever you see that is glorious, prosperous, or powerful, know that it has sprung from a mere spark of my splendor.” He is giving Arjuna a way to see the divine everywhere. He is saying, don’t get lost in the forms. Look for the splendor, the glory, the power, and know that you are seeing a spark of Me.
But finally, he dismisses even this. He says, “But what is the use of all this detailed knowledge? I support this entire universe with a single fragment of myself.”
This is the ultimate perspective. The whole vast, magnificent, infinite universe, with all its glories, is just a tiny fraction of the divine reality. He is saying, don’t get lost in the details, in the manifestations. Seek the source itself. Don’t be content with the sparks; seek the fire. The whole is infinitely greater than the sum of all its parts. The reality that you are seeking is not just in these glories; it is also that which is beyond all glory, all manifestation. That is the ultimate goal.






















Of course. Here is the eleventh chapter of Gita Darshan, with each shloka and its commentary summarized in the voice of Osho.
