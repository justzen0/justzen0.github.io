### Osho’s Commentary
Holding this vision that life is just an accident, these men of small intelligence become engaged in fierce deeds for the destruction of the world. They are filled with insatiable desire, hypocrisy, and pride. Their highest goal is the gratification of their senses. They are certain that “this is all there is.”
Bound by a hundred chains of hope, slaves to lust and anger, they try to amass wealth by any means, fair or foul, just to satisfy their desires.
This is the portrait of the modern man. A life of constant striving, of endless desire, of deep anxiety that ends only with death. And all for what? For fleeting pleasures that never satisfy. It is a life lived on the periphery, completely oblivious to the silent bliss that is waiting in the center.
