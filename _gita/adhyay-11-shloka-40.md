> Salutations to You in the East and behind. Salutations to You on all sides indeed, O All! You possess infinite strength and infinite heroism. You pervade everything; thus You are all!

### Osho’s Commentary
Salutations from all sides! Because you are All. You of infinite power, you pervade everything, and therefore, you are everything.
This is the final understanding of the devotee. Sarvam khalvidam brahma—verily, all this is Brahman. There is nothing but the divine.
When this is realized, not as a philosophy but as a direct experience, then every act becomes an act of worship. Every being is seen as a manifestation of the divine. The world is transformed from a place of conflict and separation into a sacred temple.
