### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna asks, and his questions never end. They are like leaves on a tree, like a river flowing into the ditches of the mind.
And it is not only Arjuna. The mind of every man is a question-factory. But a mind full of questions is a noisy, crowded room. How can the silent guest of truth enter? While Krishna speaks, Arjuna is not truly listening. He is busy preparing his next arrow, his next question.
Look at him. He does not ask one thing. He asks a whole string of questions at once: What is Brahman? What is Adhyatma? Karma? Adhibhuta? Adhidaiva? Adhiyajna? And how are you to be known at the moment of death? This is not the inquiry of a thirsty soul. This is the scratching of a restless intellect. The thirsty man asks only one thing: Where is the water? His whole being is focused on that one question.
The human mind uses answers only to create more questions. That is why the history of mankind is a history of ever-new questions, not of new answers. The answers have always been the same. The ultimate answer is one. The Brahma Sutras begin with one question: "Now, therefore, the inquiry into Brahman." And that is the last. After that, there is only silence.
Arjuna is asking from the head. He is trying to understand. But understanding is not a thought; it is a state of being. It does not come from effort, but from a deep, silent receptivity. A mind that is silent becomes a mirror, and the truth is reflected in it. A mind that is full of questions is like a disturbed lake; it can reflect nothing.
