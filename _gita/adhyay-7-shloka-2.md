### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now makes a promise. And not of a truth, but of a mystery—a rahasya. For a truth can be spoken, but a mystery can only be lived. He says, “I will tell you that, Arjuna, knowing which, nothing more remains to be known.”
The Upanishads tell a story. A young man, Shvetaketu, returns home, his head full of scriptures, bursting with the arrogance of knowledge. His father looks at him and asks a simple question: “You have learned so much, but have you learned that, knowing which, all is known?” Shvetaketu is humbled. He has learned many things, but he has not learned the one thing.
The world of science is a world of many keys for many locks. You need one key for physics, another for chemistry. Religion is the search for a master-key, one key that opens all the doors of existence. And that master-key is the knowing of the self.
Krishna says, “I will tell you everything, Arjuna. I will give you that master-key.” It is a tremendous promise. He is not offering another piece of information to add to your collection. He is offering a fire that will burn all your information and leave you utterly naked and new.
