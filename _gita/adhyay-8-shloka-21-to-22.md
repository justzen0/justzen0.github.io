### Osho’s Commentary
This supreme, unmanifest reality is the ultimate goal. Reaching it, there is no return. That, says Krishna, is my supreme abode.
It is not a place, but a state of being. It is the ultimate home, from which we have all wandered.
And how is this supreme reality to be attained? Bhaktya labhyas tv ananyaya—it is attainable only by a devotion that is unswerving, that is one-pointed.
Here, Krishna reveals the ultimate path. Not by intellect, not by asceticism, not by ritual, but by love. A total, unconditional love, a devotion where the devotee and the divine become one. Where there is no other desire, no other thought.
This supreme Purusha, in whom all beings exist and who pervades all—this ultimate reality reveals itself only to the heart that has become a pure flame of love.
