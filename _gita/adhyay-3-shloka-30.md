### Osho’s Commentary
And now, the final, supreme instruction. The synthesis of all that has been said.
“Renounce all actions in Me,” says Krishna. This is the path of surrender, of samarpan. It is not you who is acting; it is the divine. Offer every act, every thought, every breath to the supreme.
“With your mind focused on the Self,”—adhyatmachetasa. Remain a witness. Be centered in your own being. Let the actions flow, but you remain the watcher on the hills.
“Free from desire (nirashi) and from the sense of ‘mine’ (nirmamo).” When you have offered everything to the divine, how can there be any personal desire? How can there be any sense of ownership? Everything belongs to the whole.
And when these three conditions are fulfilled—surrender, witness-consciousness, and freedom from desire and ego—then, says Krishna, “Fight, freed from the fever,”—vigatajvarah.
All our actions are feverish. We are in a constant state of anxiety, of excitement, of tension. This is the fever. But when a man acts from a state of surrender and witness, his actions become calm, peaceful, cool. The fever is gone.
This is the ultimate secret of Karma Yoga. Act totally, but remain unattached. Fight fiercely, but remain at peace within. Be in the world, but let the divine act through you. This is the way to turn the battlefield of life into a temple of God.
