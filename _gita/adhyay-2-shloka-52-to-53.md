### Osho’s Commentary
When your intellect crosses the swamp of delusion, then you will become indifferent to all the scriptures, to all that has been heard and is yet to be heard.
When your mind, which is now confused by conflicting doctrines, becomes still and steady in the deep samadhi of the Self, then you will attain yoga.
The scriptures can only create more confusion for a mind that is already confused. They are a jungle of words. The true path is to go beyond all words, all concepts, and to find the deep, silent stillness within yourself. In that stillness, all questions dissolve, and the ultimate truth is revealed. This is the state of yoga.
