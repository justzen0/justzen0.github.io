> O mighty-armed one, this is the inferior Prakrti. Know the other Prakrti of Mine, which is however higher than this, which has taken the form of individual souls, and by which this world is upheld.

### Osho’s Commentary
Beyond these eight, says Krishna, is my higher nature, my para prakriti. The word apara means that which is near, the lower. Para means that which is beyond, the higher.
These eight are the shore on this side. Beyond them lies the other shore. And what is that other shore? It is the life-principle itself, the consciousness that holds this entire universe together. It is the ultimate reality, the uncreated, the unborn.
The whole journey of the spirit is to move from this shore to that shore. The whole science of yoga is the art of recognizing this para, this beyond, which is hidden within the ordinary.
Where is the door to this beyond? It is not in the body, which is matter. Not in the mind, which is a collection of borrowed thoughts. Not in the intellect, which is refined mechanism. Not even in the ego, which is a constructed idea. Where, then? It is in the witness of all these. The one who can see the body, see the mind, see the ego—that witnessing consciousness is the door to the beyond.
