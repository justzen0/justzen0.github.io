### Osho’s Commentary
And then, the final act of the drama. Arjuna casts down his bow and arrow. He declares, "I will not fight," and falls silent. He has reached his breaking point. His mind has created a perfect case for inaction, for escape. He is convinced that to fight is a sin and to flee is a virtue. He has fallen into a deep abyss of sorrow and confusion.
And Sanjaya says Krishna smiled—prahasanniva, as if smiling. Why this smile? It is not a smile of mockery, but of deep insight. It is a smile at the beautiful absurdity of the human mind. Arjuna says, "I am confused, I don't know what to do," and in the very next breath he makes a firm decision, "I will not fight!" Such certainty in confusion!
Krishna smiles because the patient is now ready. The ego has reached a dead end. All its own solutions have failed. The mind has exhausted itself. Now, the real therapy can begin. It is only when the disciple is utterly empty, utterly helpless, that the grace of the master can descend. Arjuna has fallen. And in this very fall, the possibility of a great rising is hidden.
