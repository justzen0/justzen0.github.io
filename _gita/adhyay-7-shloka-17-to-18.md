### Osho’s Commentary
Of the four types of devotees, the jnani, the wise man, is the highest. All are noble, but he is my very Self.
Why? Because his love is unconditional. The distressed loves God because he wants relief from pain. The seeker of wealth loves God because he wants prosperity. Their love is a means to an end. But the wise man loves God for no reason at all. His love is an end in itself.
In such a love, the separation between the lover and the beloved disappears. They become one. There is an ekabhakti, a single-pointed devotion. There is no other desire.
And when you love someone without any motive, you become one with them. Krishna says, “The wise man is my very soul.” This is the ultimate declaration of non-duality. The one who knows, becomes that which he knows. The journey ends in a total merger, a blissful union.
