### Osho’s Commentary
Another powerful image. The warriors are like moths rushing into a flame. There is a sense of a fatal, hypnotic attraction.
Why do moths rush into the fire? Perhaps they are drawn by the light, thinking it is life, not knowing it is death. So too, we are drawn by the attractions of the world, not knowing that they are all leading us towards our own dissolution.
This is the great illusion, the Maya. We chase after things that we think will give us life and happiness, but they are all just different forms of the great fire of time that consumes everything.
