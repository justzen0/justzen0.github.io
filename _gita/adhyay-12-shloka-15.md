> He, too, owing to whom the world is not disturbed, and who is not disturbed by the world, who is free from joy, impatience, fear, and anxiety, is dear to me.

### Osho’s Commentary
He is a man at peace with the world, and the world is at peace with him. His presence does not create disturbance in others, and the disturbances of the world do not create a ripple in his own being.
He has gone beyond the dualities of the mind. Harsha, the fleeting excitement of joy; amarsha, envy, impatience; bhaya, fear; and udvega, anxiety—he is free from all these.
He lives in a state of deep inner harmony. He is like a silent pool of water that perfectly reflects the sky, without being disturbed by the passing clouds. His peace is not dependent on outer circumstances; it flows from his own centered being. Such a one is dear to me.
