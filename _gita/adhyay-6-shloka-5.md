### Osho’s Commentary
A declaration of ultimate responsibility! You are your own friend, and you are your own enemy. No one else.
This is the very heart of all spirituality. It removes all excuses. You cannot blame God, you cannot blame the devil, you cannot blame fate. You, and you alone, are the creator of your bondage and your liberation.
Man is a ladder. One end touches hell, the other touches heaven. It is up to you which way you climb. The Self which has conquered the mind and the senses becomes your friend. It lifts you up. The Self which is a slave to the mind and the senses becomes your enemy. It drags you down.
Our situation is like a chariot whose charioteer is asleep, and the horses are running wild in all directions. Our senses, our desires, are these horses. But the master within, the soul, is asleep. The whole work is to awaken that master. The moment the master is awake, the same horses which were enemies become friends, and the chariot begins to move in a harmonious direction. You become the master of your own destiny.
