> While actions are being done in every way by the gunas (qualities) of Nature, one who is deluded by egoism thinks, "I am the doer."

### Osho’s Commentary
Now we come to the root of the matter. All action happens through Prakriti, through nature and its three qualities (gunas). The whole universe is a play of these three forces.
But the ego, the ahankara, which is itself a product of ignorance, appropriates these actions. It says, “I am the doer.” This is the fundamental illusion.
You are not the doer. You are the witness. Things are happening. The body gets hungry, the mind thinks thoughts, the emotions rise and fall. All this is the play of Prakriti. The one who identifies with this play, who says, “I am hungry, I am thinking, I am angry,” is the ahankaravimudhatma, the soul deluded by ego.
The wise man sees this play. He sees the qualities of nature acting upon each other. He remains a detached observer. He knows that he is the pure consciousness, the silent witness, in whose presence this whole drama unfolds.
This is the great shift in perspective that Krishna is pointing to. Move from the actor to the witness. In that very shift, you are liberated.
