> Therefore, rise up and gain fame; and, defeating the enemies, enjoy a prosperous kingdom. These have been killed by Me even earlier; be you merely an instrument, O Savyasacin (Arjuna).

### Osho’s Commentary
"Therefore, stand up!" says Krishna. "Win glory, enjoy the kingdom."
The enemies are already slain by me. You are just an instrument, nimitta-matram.
This is the heart of Karma Yoga. To act, but to act without the sense of being the actor. To understand that you are just a vehicle for a larger force.
When you act with this understanding, you are freed from the burden of the ego. You are freed from the anxiety of success and failure. You act with your full energy, but you are not attached to the result. Your action becomes a form of surrender, a way of participating in the divine play.
