### Osho’s Commentary
And here, Arjuna reveals his own heart. He says, “You alone know yourself by your own Self.” He is admitting his own inability. He is saying, “How can I know you? You are a self-luminous reality. I am in darkness.”
And then he asks a most significant question. He says, “How shall I know you? In what various aspects should I meditate upon you?”
This is the question of a true seeker. He is no longer satisfied with philosophy. He is asking for a method, a path. He is asking for a way to transform his own consciousness, so that he too can see.
And he says, “I am not satisfied by hearing your words of nectar.” Hearing is not enough. A deep thirst has arisen in him. A thirst for direct experience. The words are beautiful, but they only increase the thirst; they cannot quench it. He wants to drink from the source itself.
Krishna’s words are like a finger pointing to the moon. Arjuna has been looking at the finger. Now, he wants to see the moon. He is asking, “Show me the way. Give me a technique, a bhava, an aspect, through which my heart can connect with you.” This is the turning point. The journey from intellectual understanding to existential transformation is about to begin.
