> Shining through the functions of all the organs, yet devoid of all the organs; unattached, and verily the supporter of all; without quality, and the perceiver of qualities.

### Osho’s Commentary
It is within all beings, and it is without. It is the unmoving and also the moving.
The divine is both the silent, unmoving center and the dynamic, ever-changing periphery. It is the still point and the dance. To see only one is to see a partial truth.
Because of its subtlety, it is incomprehensible. You cannot grasp it with your gross mind. It is not an object to be known, but a presence to be felt.
It is far away, and it is very near. If you seek it outside, it is farther than the farthest star. If you seek it within, it is closer than your own breath. The journey is not in space, but in consciousness.
