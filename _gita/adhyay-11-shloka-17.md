### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna sees the familiar form of Krishna, with his crown, mace, and discus, but now it is part of a vast, blazing mass of light. It is difficult to look at, immeasurable.
This is what happens when the particular meets the universal. The personal form of Krishna, which was a source of comfort and love for Arjuna, is now seen as just one facet of an infinite, blazing reality. The personal God dissolves into the impersonal Absolute.
This can be a terrifying experience. It is like looking at the face of your beloved and suddenly seeing the entire cosmos in it. The intimacy is lost, and a sense of awe, even of fear, takes its place. Arjuna is at the threshold of this great terror and wonder.
