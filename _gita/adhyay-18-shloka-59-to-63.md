Through His grace, you will attain supreme peace and the eternal abode.<br><br>To you I have imparted this knowledge, which is more secret than any secret. Ponder over this as a whole and do as you like.

### Osho’s Commentary
If, out of your ego, you say, “I will not fight,” your resolve is in vain. Your own nature, your prakriti, will compel you. You are a Kshatriya, a warrior. Fighting is in your blood. You will have to act according to your nature.
And then, the ultimate vision: the Lord dwells in the heart of all, spinning all beings on the wheel of his maya, as if they were mounted on a machine.
This is the vision of the divine as the master puppeteer. We are just puppets on a string. Take refuge in him alone, with your whole being. By his grace, you will find supreme peace.
And then, Krishna gives Arjuna the ultimate freedom. He says, “I have taught you the most secret of all secrets. Reflect on it fully, and then, yatha icchasi tatha kuru—do as you wish.”
A true master never commands. He only gives you light. He shows you the whole map. But the final decision must be yours. Your freedom is sacred.
