> Food, which is dear to all, is of three kinds; likewise, sacrifices, austerity, and charity are also of three kinds. Listen to this classification of them.

### Osho’s Commentary
Your faith is three-fold, and so too is your food. What you eat is not just a physical matter; it is a spiritual one. The food you are drawn to reveals the quality of your own consciousness. And the food you eat, in turn, affects your consciousness. It is a circle.
And so too, says Krishna, are your sacrifices, your austerities, your acts of giving. All these are colored by the three gunas. A man may give in charity out of pure compassion, or out of a desire for fame, or out of a dull sense of duty. The outer act may be the same, but the inner quality is worlds apart.
Krishna is giving you a map of your own inner landscape. He is showing you how to become a scientist of your own being, to observe the subtle play of these three qualities in every aspect of your life.
