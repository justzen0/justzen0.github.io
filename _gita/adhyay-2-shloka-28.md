> O descendant of Bharata, all beings remain unmanifested in the beginning; they become manifested in the middle. After death, they certainly become unmanifested. What lamentation can there be for them?

### Osho’s Commentary
All beings come from the unmanifest, become manifest for a while, and then return to the unmanifest. It is like a bird appearing for a moment in the light of your lamp at night. It comes out of the darkness, flutters in the light for a moment, and then disappears back into the darkness.
Our life is just this small, manifest interval between two vast unmanifests. Where is the cause for grief? We are simply returning to the source from which we came. To lament this is to misunderstand the whole nature of existence.
