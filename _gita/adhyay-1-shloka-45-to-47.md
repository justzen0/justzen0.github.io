### Osho’s Commentary
"Alas, what a great sin we are about to commit!"
Arjuna is now completely identified with his argument. He declares that it would be better for him to be killed, unarmed and unresisting, than to commit this great sin.
And having said this, he cast aside his bow and arrow, and sank down on the seat of the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with sorrow.
He has reached his breaking point. His mind has created a perfect case for inaction, for escape. He is convinced that to fight is a sin and to flee is a virtue. He has fallen into a deep abyss of sorrow and confusion.
This is the state of the modern mind. Torn by conflict, paralyzed by analysis, unable to act with totality. This is not just Arjuna’s sorrow; it is the sorrow of all of humanity.
And it is at this very point, when the mind has reached its absolute limit, when all its own solutions have failed, that the real teaching of the Gita can begin. It is only when the disciple is utterly empty, utterly helpless, that the grace of the master can descend. Arjuna has fallen. And in this very fall, the possibility of a great rising is hidden.
