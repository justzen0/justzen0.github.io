> The ladle is Brahman, the oblations are Brahman, and the offering is poured by Brahman into the fire of Brahman. He who has concentration on Brahman as the objective can only reach Brahman.

### Osho’s Commentary
This is one of the most sublime and ecstatic declarations in the entire Gita. For the one who has awakened, everything has become divine.
The act of offering (arpanam) is God. The substance offered (havir), like ghee, is God. The fire (agnau) into which it is offered is God. The one who offers (brahmana) is also God.
For such a person, every act is a sacred ritual. Eating, walking, breathing—everything becomes an act of worship. The division between the sacred and the secular disappears. His whole life becomes a yajna, a sacrifice. And the goal to be reached by such a person, who is in this constant state of brahma-karma-samadhi—absorption in divine action—is Brahman, God, itself. He has become that which he was seeking. The seeker and the sought have become one.
