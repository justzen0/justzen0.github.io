### Osho’s Commentary
It has hands and feet everywhere, eyes and ears everywhere. It pervades all.
Do not take this literally, my friend. It is a poetic way of saying that the ultimate reality is a universal consciousness. It is not located in any one place. Its center is everywhere, and its circumference is nowhere.
We are like fish in the ocean. The ocean is within us and without us, yet the fish may spend its whole life asking, "Where is the ocean?" That which is everywhere is the most difficult to see. To see it, you need to turn your senses not outwards, but inwards. When you find the consciousness within you, you will find that the same consciousness pervades the entire universe.
