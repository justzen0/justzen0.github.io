### Osho’s Commentary
Seeing the one Lord everywhere, he does not injure his own Self by his own self.
What does it mean to injure the Self? It is to live in the illusion of separation. When you think you are separate from others, you create conflict, you create violence. And in hurting others, you are ultimately hurting your own Self, because the Self is one.
The one who sees the unity of all life can no longer harm anyone, can no longer be violent. His life becomes a song of love, of compassion. And through this, he attains the supreme goal.
