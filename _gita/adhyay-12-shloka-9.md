> If, however, you are unable to establish the mind steadily on Me, then, O Dhananjaya, seek to attain Me through the yoga of practice.

### Osho’s Commentary
And if this total absorption seems too difficult, Krishna offers another way. If you cannot take the direct leap, then practice.
The mind is a restless creature. It is not accustomed to being still. So, practice. This is abhyasa yoga, the yoga of practice.
What is this practice? It is to gently, lovingly, bring the mind back again and again to the divine. It wanders away; you bring it back. It gets lost in a thousand thoughts; you gently guide it back to the one. It is not a fight, not a struggle. It is a patient training.
Just as a musician practices his instrument day after day, until the music begins to flow effortlessly, so too, the devotee practices the remembrance of the divine, until that remembrance is no longer an effort, but his very nature.
