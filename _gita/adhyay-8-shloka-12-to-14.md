### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna gives the final technique for the moment of death. Control all the gates of the body—the senses. Confine the mind in the heart. Fix the life-force in the head, established in yoga.
And then, uttering the single syllable OM, which is Brahman itself, and remembering me, he who departs attains the supreme goal. This uttering of OM is not a physical sound. It is the anahata nada, the unstruck sound that is heard only in the deepest silence, when the mind has ceased. It is the music of existence itself. To be absorbed in this inner music while remembering the divine source is the way to the ultimate.
But this is not a technique for the unprepared. It is the culmination of a whole life of yoga. And so, Krishna adds a simpler, more universal path. The path of love, of devotion.
"For him who remembers me constantly, with a mind turned to no other, for that ever-devout yogi, I am easy to attain." Sulabhah—easy to attain.
This is the path of the heart. Not of difficult techniques, but of simple, loving remembrance. A remembrance that is not a part-time activity, but a constant, flowing stream. When your whole life becomes a remembrance of the divine, when your heart is filled with that love, then the divine is not a distant goal. It is easily available, here and now. For such a loving heart, the path is not a struggle, but a joyful dance.
