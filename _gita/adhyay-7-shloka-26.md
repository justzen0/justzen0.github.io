### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna speaks from the state of cosmic consciousness, a state beyond time. He says, “I know the past, the present, and the future.”
For us, time is a linear progression. But from a higher state of consciousness, time is seen as an eternal now. The past has not gone, the future has already arrived. The whole drama of existence is happening simultaneously. It is like a man standing on a high mountain who can see the entire valley at once—the path that has been traveled, and the path that is yet to come.
From this timeless perspective, Krishna sees all. But, he says, “No one knows me.” We, who are trapped in the river of time, cannot know the one who is on the shore. We see only a small fragment, a passing moment. To know the whole, we too have to step out of the river of time and enter the ocean of the timeless.
