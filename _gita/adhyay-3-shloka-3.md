> The Blessed Lord said, O unblemished one, two kinds of steadfastness in this world were spoken of by Me in days gone by—through the Yoga of Knowledge for the men of realization; through the Yoga of Action for the yogis.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna speaks, and his first word to Arjuna is Anagha—O sinless one. This is a profound psychological key. Arjuna is drowning in guilt. He feels he is about to commit a great sin by killing his kinsmen. Guilt is a paralysis. It makes a man indecisive, weak, fragmented.
Before giving any answer, Krishna first frees him from his guilt. He says, “You are sinless.” This is not just a word; coming from a man like Krishna, it is a transmission. In his eyes, in his voice, in his very presence, Arjuna must have felt a wave of purity washing over him, a reassurance that the sin is not in the action, but in the ego that performs it. Krishna is giving him the ground to stand on, the courage to listen.
Then he says, “I have already told you of the two paths.” He is not giving a new teaching; he is simply repeating it with a new emphasis. There is Jnana Yoga, the path of knowledge, for the Sankhyas—those whose nature is contemplative, introspective. And there is Karma Yoga, the path of action, for the Yogis—those whose nature is active, dynamic.
The path is not to be chosen by your desire or your fear. The path is to be chosen according to your intrinsic nature, your swabhava. You are what you are. The way to God must pass through the door of your own being.
