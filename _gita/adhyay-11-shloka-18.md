### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna is struggling to find words. He uses the highest philosophical terms: you are the Imperishable, the supreme reality to be known, the resting place of the universe, the guardian of eternal dharma.
And then, he says something very humble and very honest: mato me—“this is my opinion.”
After this stupendous, mind-shattering vision, he does not claim it as the ultimate truth. He says, “This is what it seems like to me.” This is a profound statement of humility. He is admitting that his words are inadequate, that his perception is limited.
The ego claims, “This is the truth!” The humble heart says, “This is my understanding.” Arjuna, even in this state of divine revelation, remains free from the arrogance of the knower.
