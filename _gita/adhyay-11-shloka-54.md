> But, O Arjuna, by single-minded devotion am I, in this form, able to be known and seen in reality, and also entered into, O destroyer of foes.

### Osho’s Commentary
But by a devotion that is single-minded, bhaktya tu ananyaya, I can be known, seen, and entered into.
Here is the final key. The path is love. A love that is one-pointed, that is not directed to any other.
And this love leads to three stages:
First, you come to know the divine intellectually.
Then, you come to see the divine directly, in a vision.
And finally, you enter into the divine, you merge with it completely.
This is the ultimate goal of the path of devotion. Not just to see God, but to become one with God. To dissolve your separate self into the ocean of divine love.
