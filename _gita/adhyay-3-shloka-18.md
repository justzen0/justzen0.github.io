### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna is describing the ultimate freedom. The man who is centered in his own Self is completely free from the world of cause and effect, of purpose and motive.
For him, there is nothing to be gained by doing anything, and nothing to be lost by not doing anything. He has no purpose, no goal. He has already arrived. His journey is over. He is simply a presence, a pure existence.
And he is not dependent on anyone for anything. His joy is his own. His bliss is his own. It does not come from the outside. He is utterly alone, but not lonely. He is an emperor in his own right.
This is the goal of all spiritual seeking: to arrive at this state of total independence, of absolute freedom. To be so full within oneself that nothing is needed from the outside. To be so content that even the idea of God becomes irrelevant. When you are full of light, who needs to search for the sun? You have become the sun.
