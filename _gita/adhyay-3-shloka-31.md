### Osho’s Commentary
Now, the fruit of this teaching. Krishna says those who follow this path with shraddha and without anasuya are also liberated from karma.
What is this shraddha? It is not blind belief. The word shraddha has no equivalent in English. It is not faith in a doctrine or a dogma. Shraddha is a total trust that is born of a deep existential experience. It is the trust of a child holding his father’s hand in a crowded marketplace. It is the trust of a disciple in the presence of an enlightened master. It is a relaxation into the mystery of existence, a deep acceptance of ‘what is’. It is a state of being where all doubt, all questioning, has ceased—not because it has been answered, but because it has become irrelevant in the face of a direct experience of reality.
And anasuya means without finding fault, without caviling. The mind loves to find fault. It is its nature to dissect, to analyze, to criticize. But this is the way of the intellect, not the way of the heart. The path of shraddha is the path of the heart. It is an innocent acceptance, a loving embrace of the truth.
One who walks this path, says Krishna, is also freed from the bondage of action.
