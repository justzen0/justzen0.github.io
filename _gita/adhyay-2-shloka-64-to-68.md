### Osho’s Commentary
And now, the upward path. The self-controlled man, free from the pull of attraction and repulsion, also moves among the objects of the senses. But he attains a state of serene peace, prasadam.
In this peace, all his sorrows are destroyed. The intellect of such a tranquil-minded man soon becomes steady.
The unsteady man has no wisdom, no concentration. Without concentration, there is no peace. And for the un-peaceful, how can there be happiness?
Just as the wind carries away a ship on the waters, so does the mind that follows the wandering senses carry away his discrimination.
Therefore, O mighty-armed, he whose senses are completely restrained from their objects, his wisdom is firmly set.
