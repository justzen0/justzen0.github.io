### Osho’s Commentary
When a man sees that the whole diversity of existence is rooted in the One, and that from that One alone it has spread forth, then he attains to Brahman.
This is the vision of the tree of life. The branches, the leaves, the flowers—they are many. But they are all rooted in one, single trunk. They all draw their life from the same source.
So too, all the diverse forms of this universe are rooted in the one, absolute reality. When you see this unity in diversity, your own separate identity dissolves. You realize that you are not just a leaf on the tree, but the tree itself. You become one with Brahman.
