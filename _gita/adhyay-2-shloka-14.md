> But the contacts of the organs with the objects are the producers of cold and heat, happiness, and sorrow. They have a beginning and an end and are transient. Bear them, O descendant of Bharata.

### Osho’s Commentary
Pleasure and pain, heat and cold—they all arise from the contact of the senses with the world. And they are all fleeting. They come and they go. They are like clouds passing in the sky.
Krishna is not telling Arjuna to become insensitive. He is telling him to become a witness. To endure them, titikshasva, means to watch them without getting identified. When pleasure comes, watch it. When pain comes, watch it. Know that you are the sky, and these are just passing clouds.
The one who can witness the duality of life without being swayed by it finds a deep inner balance, a serenity that is unshakable.
