> But in the case of those whose ignorance is destroyed by knowledge (of the Self), their knowledge, like the sun, reveals that supreme Reality.

### Osho’s Commentary
For those whose ignorance has been destroyed by knowledge, that knowledge reveals the supreme Reality, just as the sun reveals the world.
Knowledge is like the sun. When the sun rises, the darkness of the night does not have to be fought. It simply disappears. It was never there in the first place; it was only the absence of light.
So too, ignorance is not a positive entity. It is simply the absence of self-knowing. When the sun of self-knowledge rises within you, the darkness of ignorance, with all its delusions of sin and virtue, simply vanishes. And in that brilliant light, the supreme truth, the ultimate reality, is revealed in all its glory.
