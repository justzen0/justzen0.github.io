### Osho’s Commentary
He is anapekshah, without expectations. He does not demand anything from life. He accepts whatever comes with a deep gratitude.
He is shuchir, pure, both inwardly and outwardly.
He is dakshah, skillful in action, yet unconcerned with the result. He lives in a state of let-go, udasino.
He is gatavyathah, free from all mental anguish.
And he has renounced all selfish undertakings. His actions are not for his own gain, but for the good of the whole.
This is the man who has learned the art of living in the world without being of the world. He participates in the play of life, but he remains a detached witness. Such a one is dear to me.
