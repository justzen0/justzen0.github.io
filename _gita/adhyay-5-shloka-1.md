> Arjuna said, "O Krsna, you praise renunciation of actions and, at the same time, Karma-yoga. Please tell me for certain which one is better between these two."

### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna asks, and his question sounds so simple, so pious. “O Krishna,” he says, “you speak of renouncing action, and you speak of the yoga of action. Just tell me one thing, one clear path, so that I may be free.”
But is this a true question? Or is it a shield? Look at the cunning of the human mind. It wants an order, an instruction, because to decide for oneself is an agony. To think for oneself is an austerity. The mind is so full of laziness, of tamas, it wants to be given a ready-made truth.
A borrowed conclusion is a dead thing. It is like a flower plucked from the garden and put in a vase—beautiful for a day, but with no roots, no life. A true understanding is a seed that grows within you, that draws its own juice from the soil of your being, that blossoms in the sun of your own consciousness. It is alive.
Arjuna is not asking for truth; he is asking for an escape from the pain of choice. “Just tell me what to do,” he pleads. “Save me from this confusion.” But a true master never gives a command. He only gives you light, so you can see all the paths for yourself. The final decision must always be your own.
