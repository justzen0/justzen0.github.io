> O son of Kunti, whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as a sacrifice, whatever you give, and whatever austerities you undertake—all of that you offer to Me.<br><br>Thus, you will become free from bondage in the form of actions which are productive of good and bad results. Having your mind imbued with the yoga of renunciation and becoming free, you will attain Me.

### Osho’s Commentary
The yogi who knows these two paths is never deluded. He knows the map of consciousness. He knows which way leads to freedom and which to bondage. And so, Krishna urges Arjuna, "Therefore, at all times, be steadfast in yoga." Be constantly aware, constantly balanced between the opposites.
And the final, glorious conclusion: the yogi who knows this supreme secret goes beyond all the fruits of so-called good deeds. The rewards promised in scriptures, sacrifices, austerities, and charity—these are all part of the lower path, the path of return.
The true yogi is not interested in these heavenly pleasures. He transcends them all. He is not seeking a reward; he is seeking the ultimate reality itself. And knowing this, he attains the supreme, ancient, original home from which he came. He does not just attain a result; he becomes one with the source of all. This is the ultimate victory.
















Of course. Here is the ninth chapter of Gita Darshan, with each shloka and its commentary summarized in the voice of Osho.
