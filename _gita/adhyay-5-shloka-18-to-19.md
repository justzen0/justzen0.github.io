### Osho’s Commentary
The one who has realized the supreme truth becomes samadarshinah, one who sees with an equal eye.
For him, the outer forms and labels have lost their meaning. A learned Brahmin or an outcaste, a cow, an elephant, or a dog—in all these varied forms, he sees the same divine light shining. The outer differences are just ripples on the surface of the same ocean.
For one whose mind is established in this vision of equality, samye sthitam manah, he has conquered the world right here and now. He is free. Because Brahman, the ultimate reality, is flawless and equal in all, by seeing this equality everywhere, he himself becomes established in Brahman. He has realized the unity that underlies all diversity.
