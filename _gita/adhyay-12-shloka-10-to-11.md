> If you are unable even to practice, be intent on works for Me. By undertaking works for Me as well, you will attain perfection. [Identify with Brahman.]<br><br>If you are unable to do even this, then resort to the Yoga for Me and afterwards, control your mind and renounce the results of all your works.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna offers a ladder of possibilities, each step simpler than the one before.
If you cannot fix your mind in total absorption, then practice.
If even practice is difficult, then simply do all your actions for my sake. Let every act of your life be an offering to me. When you work not for yourself but for the divine, the ego slowly begins to dissolve. The action itself becomes a form of worship.
And if even this is difficult, then just do one thing: renounce the fruits of all your actions. This is the simplest, and perhaps the most profound, path of all. You continue to act, but you are not concerned with the result. You do your best, and then you leave the outcome to the cosmos.
When you are not attached to the fruit, you are freed from the fever of success and failure. You are freed from anxiety. And in that inner freedom, you find a deep peace. In that peace, the divine is not far away.
