> Know that action has the Vedas as its origin; the Vedas have the Immutable as their source. Hence, the all-pervading Vedas are forever based on sacrifice.

### Osho’s Commentary
Action comes from Brahma, and Brahma comes from the Imperishable, the Absolute. What does this mean?
It means that the source of all action is not you. The source is the ultimate reality itself. The river of life flows from the ocean of the imperishable. Action that is born of ignorance, of the ego, is what we call ordinary karma. But action that is born of knowledge, of a consciousness connected to the source, is Yajna.
This knowledge is the Veda. And when Krishna says the Veda, he does not mean a particular book. He means the ultimate knowing that arises when the ego is not. This knowing is not created by man; it is a revelation from the cosmos. It flows through those who have become empty vessels.
Such a person, whose actions are born of this ultimate knowing, is in tune with the all-pervading Brahma. For him, God is not a distant entity but a living presence in every act. His whole life becomes a sacrifice, a sacred ritual.
The ego creates a separation between you and the whole. When the ego dissolves, this separation disappears. You become one with the flow. Then you are not the actor; the whole acts through you. And in that state of non-doing, the all-pervading divine is forever present.
