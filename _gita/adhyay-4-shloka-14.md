### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna reveals the secret of freedom in action. “Actions do not touch me, because I have no desire for their fruit.”
It is not action that binds you; it is the desire for the result that creates the chain. When you act with your eyes on the future, on the reward, you are creating anxiety, you are creating bondage. Your action is no longer a joy in itself; it has become a means to an end.
The divine acts out of sheer joy, out of overflowing energy. The action is its own reward. There is no motive beyond the act itself. It is a play, a leela.
He who understands this, who knows this nature of the divine, is also freed. He learns the art of acting without attachment to the fruit. He pours his whole energy into the action, but he leaves the result to the cosmos. He does his best and then lets go. Such a man, though living in the world and acting, remains untouched, unbound. He has learned the secret of divine play.
