> Having given up attachment to the results of action, he who is ever-content, dependent on nothing, does not really do anything even though he is engaged in action.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna describes the inner state of such a sage.
Tyaktva karmaphalasangam—He has abandoned all attachment to the fruit of action. He finds his joy in the doing, not in the result.
Nityatripto—He is ever-content. His contentment does not depend on outer circumstances. It flows from his own inner being.
Nirashrayah—He is dependent on nothing. He stands alone, free, leaning on no one and nothing, not even God. He has found his own center.
Such a man, even when he is fully engaged in action, naiva kinchit karoti sah—he does nothing at all. Why? Because the doer, the ego, is absent. The action flows through him, but he is not its source. He is a witness. From the outside, he may seem busy. From the inside, there is only a vast silence, a profound stillness. He is the still point at the center of the turning wheel.
