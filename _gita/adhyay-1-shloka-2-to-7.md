I speak of them to you by way of illustration.

### Osho’s Commentary
Duryodhana speaks. And his first words are not of his own army, but of the enemy’s. Strange, is it not? A man drowning in an inferiority complex speaks always of his own greatness. But one who is truly sure of himself can afford to praise his enemy. Duryodhana is not a weak man; his evil is confident, self-assured. And in this, he is more authentic than many a so-called good man whose goodness is just skin-deep, a fragile mask hiding a deep uncertainty.
And to whom does his eye go? To Bhima. He sees Bhima as the equal of Arjuna, the real threat. The whole world will later see this war as a dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna, but at the start, Duryodhana, a man of brute force, sees only the brute force of Bhima as his true adversary. They are of the same earth, the same primal nature. He cannot comprehend the subtle mind of Arjuna. An intellectual is always unreliable in a fight; his mind is a space of doubt. But a man of pure muscle, like Bhima, is predictable. Duryodhana understands him perfectly.
This is how we all live. We make our calculations based on the visible, the known, the predictable. But life is always an intervention of the unknown. The real player on this battlefield is not Bhima, not even Arjuna. It is the silent charioteer, Krishna—the invisible, the unpredictable, the divine. And his entry will change the whole mathematics of this war. Duryodhana, in his confident calculation, has completely overlooked the one factor that will decide everything. He has calculated the visible forces, but he is blind to the invisible grace that is about to descend.
