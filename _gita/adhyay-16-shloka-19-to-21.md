> I cast forever those hateful, cruel, evil-doers in the worlds, the vilest of human beings, verily into the demonic classes.<br><br>Being born among the demoniacal species in birth after birth, the souls, without ever reaching Me, O son of Kunti, attain conditions lower than that.<br><br>This door to hell, which destroys the soul, is of three kinds—passion, anger, and greed. Therefore, one should forsake these three.

### Osho’s Commentary
These cruel haters, these worst of men, I hurl them again and again into demonic wombs. And falling into such wombs, birth after birth, they never find me and go down to the lowest state.
This is not a punishment from a personal God. This is the infallible law of karma. The state of your consciousness creates your future. If you live in a state of hate and cruelty, you create a destiny that will lead you to situations where this hate and cruelty can be further expressed. You are the creator of your own prison.
And then Krishna gives the key: there are three gates to this self-made hell—Kama (lust, desire), Krodha (anger), and Lobha (greed). These three are the destroyers of the self. Therefore, abandon them.
These are not three separate things. They are three faces of one energy. When desire is obstructed, it becomes anger. When desire is unbridled, it becomes greed. At the root is desire, the constant wanting of the mind. To go beyond these three is to find the key to liberation.
