> This word "sat" is used with regard to something coming into being and someone becoming good. Likewise, O son of Prtha, the word "sat" is used with regard to an auspicious rite.<br><br>And the steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity, and charity is spoken of as sat (good). And even the action meant for these is, indeed, called as sat.

### Osho’s Commentary
The word Sat is used for that which is real, that which is good, and that which is auspicious.
To be steadfast in your spiritual practices is Sat. And all action that is done for the sake of the divine is also Sat.
Sat is the quality of truth, of reality, of goodness. To bring this quality into every aspect of your life—into your thoughts, your words, your deeds—is to live a life that is in tune with the ultimate reality.
