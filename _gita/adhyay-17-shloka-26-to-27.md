> This word "sat" is used with regard to something coming into being and someone becoming good. Likewise, O son of Prtha, the word "sat" is used with regard to an auspicious rite.<br><br>And the steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity, and charity is spoken of as sat (good). And even the action meant for these is, indeed, called as sat.
