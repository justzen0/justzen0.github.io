### Osho’s Commentary
The real victory is not over outer enemies, but over the inner impulses of desire (kama) and anger (krodha).
He who can withstand this powerful inner current, this vegam, before he leaves the body, he is a true yogi. He is a happy man.
These two energies, desire and anger, are constantly arising within us. To be swept away by them is to be a slave. To be able to stand as a witness, to let them rise and pass without being identified with them—this is mastery. This is freedom. And in this freedom is true happiness, a happiness that is not dependent on any outer condition, but is born of one’s own inner sovereignty.
