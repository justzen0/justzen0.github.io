### Osho’s Commentary
This form which you have seen is very difficult to behold. Even the gods long to see it. It cannot be seen through any external means.
Krishna again emphasizes the rarity and the grace of this vision. It is not something that can be achieved through effort alone.
The gods represent the highest state that can be achieved through good karma, through effort. But even they long for this vision. This means that the ultimate reality is beyond the realm of karma, beyond the world of cause and effect. It can only be accessed through a different dimension—the dimension of love, of grace, of surrender.
