### Osho’s Commentary
After this long and glorious description, Krishna brings it all to a final, magnificent conclusion.
He says, “I am the seed of all beings. Nothing can exist without me.” And my glories are endless. What I have told you is just a brief hint.
And then, a simple key for Arjuna to use in his own life: “Whatever you see that is glorious, prosperous, or powerful, know that it has sprung from a mere spark of my splendor.” He is giving Arjuna a way to see the divine everywhere. He is saying, don’t get lost in the forms. Look for the splendor, the glory, the power, and know that you are seeing a spark of Me.
But finally, he dismisses even this. He says, “But what is the use of all this detailed knowledge? I support this entire universe with a single fragment of myself.”
This is the ultimate perspective. The whole vast, magnificent, infinite universe, with all its glories, is just a tiny fraction of the divine reality. He is saying, don’t get lost in the details, in the manifestations. Seek the source itself. Don’t be content with the sparks; seek the fire. The whole is infinitely greater than the sum of all its parts. The reality that you are seeking is not just in these glories; it is also that which is beyond all glory, all manifestation. That is the ultimate goal.
