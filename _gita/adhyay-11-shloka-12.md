### Osho’s Commentary
The light of a thousand suns, rising at once! Even this, says Sanjaya, is only a pale comparison.
Our experience of light is limited. We know the light of a lamp, the light of the sun. But the light of pure consciousness is of a different quality altogether. It is a light without a source, a light that is cool, not hot. It is the light of pure being.
When a seeker turns inwards and the darkness of the mind begins to recede, he first experiences this inner light. It is a blissful, silent luminosity. What Arjuna is seeing is the cosmic explosion of this very light. The light of a thousand suns is just a metaphor to hint at something that is utterly beyond human comprehension.
