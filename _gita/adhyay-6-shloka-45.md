### Osho’s Commentary
The yogi who strives with diligent effort, purified of all sins, becomes perfected through many births, and then attains the supreme goal.
The journey may be long. It may take many lifetimes. But for the one who strives with perseverance, success is certain.
Each life becomes a step on the ladder. The impurities are washed away, the consciousness is evolved. And then, a moment comes when he is fully perfected. In that moment of perfection, he attains the supreme state, the ultimate liberation.
