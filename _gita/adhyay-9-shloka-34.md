> Having your mind fixed on Me, be devoted to Me, sacrifice to Me, and bow down to Me. By concentrating your mind and accepting Me as the supreme goal, you shall surely attain Me, who am thus the Self.

### Osho’s Commentary
And now, the final, supreme instruction of this chapter, the very essence of the path of devotion. Krishna gives a four-fold path.
Manmana bhava—Become my-minded. Let your mind be so filled with me that there is no room for anything else. Let your every thought be a thought of me.
Madbhakto—Become my devotee. Let your heart be so filled with love for me that your whole being becomes a flame of devotion.
Madyaji—Sacrifice to me. Let your every action be an offering to me, a sacrifice at my feet.
Mam namaskuru—Bow down to me. Let your ego be completely surrendered. Let there be a total bowing down of your being before the divine.
When these four are fulfilled—when your mind, your heart, your actions, and your very ego are all offered to the divine—then, having me as your supreme goal, you will surely come to me. This is not a promise for a future life. In that very moment of total surrender, the union happens. The seeker disappears, and only the divine remains.
