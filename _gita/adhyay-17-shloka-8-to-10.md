### Osho’s Commentary
The sattvic man is drawn to food that promotes life, that is full of juice, of vitality. His food is a celebration of life. It brings health, joy, and a subtle sense of peace.
The rajasic man is drawn to food that is extreme—too hot, too spicy, too salty. His food is a reflection of his own inner restlessness and passion. Such food creates agitation, excitement, and ultimately, pain and disease. It fuels the fire of his desire.
And the tamasic man is drawn to food that is stale, tasteless, rotten, impure. He is drawn to that which is dead. His food is a reflection of his own inner inertia and darkness. It pulls him deeper into a state of unconsciousness.
Look at your plate, my friend. It is a mirror. What you choose to eat is a choice about the kind of consciousness you want to cultivate within yourself. To move towards a sattvic diet is not just a matter of health; it is a step towards a more pure, more luminous, more meditative state of being.
