### Osho’s Commentary
A paradox that can drive the mind mad! Krishna says, “The entire universe is pervaded by my unmanifest form. All beings rest in me, but I do not rest in them.”
And then, as if this were not enough, he turns it on its head and says, “And yet, beings do not rest in me. Behold my divine magic!”
This is not a mathematical equation to be solved. This is a mystery to be experienced. The intellect will be shattered by this. Krishna is speaking of four levels of attraction. The lowest is the physical, the gravitational pull between matter. Higher than that is the biological, the sexual pull between bodies. Higher still is the mental, the pull of love between two minds. But the fourth, the ultimate attraction, is shraddha—the spiritual pull between two souls. It is a trust so total that it becomes a transformation.
When Krishna says, “All beings are in me,” he is speaking of this ultimate spiritual gravity. All of creation is held within his being. But then he says, “I am not in them.” How can this be? The ocean is in the wave, but is the wave in the ocean? Yes, and no. The wave is made of the ocean, but the vastness of the ocean is not contained within the smallness of the wave.
And then the final leap: “Beings are not in me.” This is to point to a reality that is utterly transcendental. It is like this: you are sitting in this room. The space of this room is part of the vast space outside. So, the room is in space. But is space in the room? Yes, in a way. But is the whole of space contained in this small room? No. The room itself is just an appearance within space. The walls create an illusion of a separate room, but the space remains one.
So too, all of creation is just an appearance, a dream, in the vast consciousness of the divine. He is the sustainer, and yet he is utterly untouched. This is his divine yoga, his supreme magic. It cannot be understood, it can only be seen with the eyes of trust.
