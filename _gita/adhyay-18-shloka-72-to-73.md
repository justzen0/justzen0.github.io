### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna asks the final question: “Have you heard with a concentrated mind? Is your delusion destroyed?”
And Arjuna’s reply is the culmination of the whole journey. He does not say, “I have understood your philosophy.” He says, Nashto mohah—my delusion is destroyed. Smritir labdha—I have regained my memory.
What is this memory? It is the memory of the Self, the memory of who you truly are. It is the remembrance of your own divine nature.
Tvåt-prasadån—by your grace. It is not my achievement, but a gift from you.
Sthito’smi gata-sandehah—I stand firm, my doubts have vanished.
And finally, Karishye vachanam tava—I will do your bidding.
The argument is over. The mind is silent. The heart has surrendered. The individual will has merged with the divine will. This is the state of a true disciple. This is the ultimate victory.
