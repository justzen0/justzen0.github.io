### Osho’s Commentary
And now, the final, supreme word, the most secret of all. Krishna says, “You are dearly beloved of me, so I will speak for your ultimate good.”
Fix your mind on me. Be my devotee. Sacrifice to me. Bow down to me. And you will surely come to me. This is my promise to you, for you are dear to me.
And finally, the ultimate leap, the very peak of the Gita’s message:
Sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam sharanam vraja—Abandon all dharmas and take refuge in me alone.
Drop all your concepts of right and wrong, all your moralities, all your religions. Drop everything. And just take refuge in the divine.
Aham tva sarva-papebhyo mokshayishyami ma shuchah—I will liberate you from all sins. Do not grieve.
This is the ultimate promise of grace. When you have surrendered completely, when you have dropped your own small self and taken refuge in the whole, then the whole takes care of you. You are freed from all sin, because the sinner itself has disappeared. Do not worry. Do not grieve. Simply surrender. This is the final and most beautiful secret.
