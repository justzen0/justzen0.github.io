> It is indeed a part of Mine that, becoming the eternal individual soul in the region of living beings, draws the organs, which have the mind as their sixth, and which abide in Nature.<br><br>When the master leaves it and even when he assumes a body, he departs taking these with him, just as the wind carries away odours from their receptacles.

### Osho’s Commentary
A fragment of my own eternal being becomes a soul in this world. And this soul draws to itself the five senses and the mind, which all belong to nature, to Prakriti.
And when this soul leaves a body at death, it carries with it the subtle essence of these senses, just as the wind carries the fragrance from a flower. The flower is left behind, but its scent travels with the wind. So too, the physical body is left behind, but the subtle body, the vehicle of all your desires and karmic impressions, travels with the soul to a new birth.
You are that eternal spark of the divine. But you have attracted to yourself a covering of mind and senses. And it is this covering, this fragrance of desire, that carries you from one life to another. To become free is to become fragrance-less, to become so pure that the wind of transmigration has nothing left to carry.
