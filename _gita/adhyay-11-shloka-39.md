> You are air, death, fire, the god of the waters, the moon, the Lord of creatures, and the great-grandfather. Salutations to you a thousand times! Salutations to you again and again! Salutations!

### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna sees the divine in all the forces of nature—in the wind, in fire, in water. He sees him as Yama, the lord of death. And he sees him as the great-grandfather, the ultimate ancestor.
His heart is overflowing with reverence. He can do nothing but bow down, again and again. His words are a torrent of salutations.
This is the state of the devotee when he is filled with the divine presence. The intellect is silent. The heart is overflowing. And the only language that remains is the language of love, of reverence, of total surrender.
