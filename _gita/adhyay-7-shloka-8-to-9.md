> O son of Kunti, I am the taste of water, I am the effulgence of the moon and the sun; the letter 'Om' in all the Vedas, the sound in space, and manhood in men.<br><br>I am also the sweet fragrance in the earth; I am the brilliance in the fire, and the life in all beings; and I am the austerity of the ascetics.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now points to the unseen in the seen.
“I am the taste in water.” You drink the water, but the taste is an inner experience, an unseen reality.
“I am the light in the sun and moon.” You see the sun, the moon, but the light itself is an invisible presence that makes seeing possible.
“I am the sacred fragrance in the earth.” There are fragrances that pull the life energy downwards, towards sexuality. And there is a fragrance that arises from a saintly being, from a Mahavira, that pulls the life energy upwards. I am that sacred fragrance.
“I am the brilliance in fire, the austerity in ascetics.” Just as there is a visible austerity, there is an inner fire, a luminosity that is the real austerity. It is not what the ascetic does, but what he is.
“I am the sound in the ether.” The sky is filled with sound, but it is too subtle for our ears.
“I am the virility in men, free from passion and desire.” This is a different kind of virility altogether. Not the one born of lust, which is a state of unconsciousness, but the one born of a total conservation of energy, of awareness. It is a creative force, not a blind urge.
Krishna is pointing everywhere to the hidden thread, the invisible essence. Look beyond the form, he is saying, and you will find Me.
