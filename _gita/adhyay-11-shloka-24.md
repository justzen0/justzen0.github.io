> O Vishnu, indeed, upon seeing Your form touching the heavens, blazing with many colors, open-mouthed, with fiery, large eyes, I become terrified in my mind and do not find steadiness and peace.

### Osho’s Commentary
Touching the sky, blazing, with mouths wide open and fiery eyes! "My very soul is terrified," says Arjuna. "I find no courage, no peace."
The vision has become unbearable. The human psyche has a limit to what it can endure. Arjuna has reached that limit. The experience is so overwhelming that it has thrown his entire being into a state of turmoil.
This is the dark night of the soul, a necessary stage on the spiritual path. Before the ultimate peace can descend, all your inner chaos must be brought to the surface. Before you can find true courage, you must face your ultimate fear. Arjuna is in the midst of this great inner crisis.
