> Without knowing Your greatness, whatever I said rashly, inadvertently, or even out of familiarity, thinking You to be a friend, addressing You as 'O Krsna,' 'O Yadava,' 'O friend,' etc.<br><br>And that You have been discourteously treated out of fun—while walking, while on a bed, while on a seat, while eating, in privacy, or, O Acyuta, even in public—for that, I beg pardon of You, the incomprehensible One.

### Osho’s Commentary
Now, a deep sense of remorse comes over Arjuna. He remembers how he has treated Krishna as an ordinary friend. He has called him by familiar names, he has joked with him, he has shown him disrespect, not knowing his true glory. And for all this, he begs forgiveness.
This is a beautiful and very human moment. When you have a glimpse of the divine, you become aware of your own blindness, your own ignorance. You see how you have been living in a dream, taking the ultimate reality for granted.
This begging for forgiveness is not out of guilt, but out of a deep sense of love and awe. It is a recognition of the vast gap between the human and the divine, and a prayer to be worthy of the great gift that has been received.
