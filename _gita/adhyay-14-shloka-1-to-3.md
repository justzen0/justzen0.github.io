> The Blessed Lord said, "I shall speak again of the supreme knowledge, the best of all knowledge, by realizing which all the contemplatives have reached the highest perfection from here."<br><br>Those who attain identity with Me by resorting to this Knowledge are not born even during creation, nor do they suffer pain during dissolution.<br><br>My womb is the great sustainer. In it, I place the seed. From that, O scion of the Bharata dynasty, all things are born.

### Osho’s Commentary
My beloved one, listen. Krishna says he will speak again of the supreme knowledge. A guru never tires. He will speak a thousand times, for the disciple is deaf. He will knock on your door in a thousand ways, for your doors are closed. His compassion is infinite.
And this supreme knowledge is not just another piece of information. It is a fire that burns ignorance itself. It is the knowing by which one is freed not only from this world of coming and going, but even from the great cosmic cycles of creation and dissolution. The one who knows this is not disturbed even when the whole universe dissolves in pralaya. He has found his eternal home.
What is this secret? It is this: that this whole of nature, this Prakriti, is my womb. And into this womb of matter, I place the seed of consciousness. From this union of matter and spirit, of earth and sky, all of creation is born.
You are this meeting point. Your body is matter, the field, the womb. But within it is a spark of the divine, the seed, the consciousness. Your body belongs to the world of the three gunas—the play of nature. But you, the one who dwells within, you belong to the eternal. To forget this is to be in bondage. To remember this is to be liberated.
