### Osho’s Commentary
The one who truly knows the spirit and nature with its qualities—in whatever way he may live, he is not born again.
This is the ultimate promise of knowledge. When you have truly seen the distinction between the unchanging witness and the ever-changing play of nature, you are liberated.
And this liberation is not dependent on your outer lifestyle. Sarvatha vartamano'pi—in whatever way he may live. He may be a king in a palace or a beggar on the street. It makes no difference. The inner knowing is the only thing that matters. When that is achieved, you are freed from the wheel of birth and death, right here and now.
