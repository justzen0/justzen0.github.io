### Osho’s Commentary
Of all sacrifices, Krishna declares, the sacrifice of knowledge—jnanayajna—is the highest.
You can offer wealth, you can offer rituals, you can offer austerities. These are all good, but they are sacrifices of material things, dravyamayat. The sacrifice of knowledge is far superior.
What is the sacrifice of knowledge? It is the sacrifice of your ignorance, your ego, your prejudices, your borrowed beliefs. It is the willingness to die to what you think you know, in order to be open to what is.
And ultimately, says Krishna, all actions, sarvam karma akhilam, in their totality, find their culmination, their fulfillment, in knowledge. Action is the path, but knowledge is the destination. You act to purify yourself, to become ready. But the final liberation happens only when the light of knowing dawns. Action is the preparation of the soil; knowledge is the flowering.
