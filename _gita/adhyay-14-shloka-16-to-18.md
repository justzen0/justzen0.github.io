> They say that the result of good work is pure and is born of Sattva. But the result of Rajas is sorrow; the result of Tamas is ignorance.<br><br>From sattva is born knowledge, and from rajas, avarice indeed. From tamas are born inadvertence, delusion, and ignorance, to be sure.<br><br>People who conform to sattva go higher up; those who conform to rajas stay in the middle; those who conform to tamas, who conform to the actions of the lowest quality, go down.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna summarizes the fruits of the three gunas.
The fruit of sattvic action is purity, happiness, knowledge, and non-attachment. It is a subtle and beautiful fruit.
The fruit of rajasic action is pain. Why? Because it is born of desire, and desire is a fire that always leaves you thirsty for more. It is a journey that never reaches a destination.
The fruit of tamasic action is ignorance, a deepening of your unconsciousness.
From sattva comes knowledge. From rajas comes greed. From tamas comes delusion.
And so, the sattvic man moves upwards, towards higher states of being. The rajasic man remains in the middle, in the world of men. And the tamasic man moves downwards, into lower forms of existence.
You are the creator of your own heaven and your own hell. The choice is yours in every moment. Which quality are you feeding? Which direction are you moving?
