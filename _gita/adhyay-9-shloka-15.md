### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now speaks of the three great paths of worship, the three fundamental ways of approaching the divine.
The first is the path of knowledge, of jnana. This is the path of seeing the divine as ekatvena, as absolute oneness. This is the path of Advaita Vedanta. The seeker dissolves his own identity into the cosmic whole. The drop disappears into the ocean. The knower, the known, and the knowing become one. For this path, all separation is an illusion.
The second is the path of devotion, of bhakti. This is the path of seeing the divine as prithaktvena, as distinct. This is the path of duality. The devotee remains separate from the divine, so that a relationship of love is possible. The lover needs a beloved. The worshipper needs a god. For this path, the joy is not in merging, but in the sweet agony of separation and the bliss of communion.
And the third is the path of action, of karma. This is the path of seeing the divine as bahudha, as manifold. The Karma Yogi sees the divine in every form, in every being. For him, to serve a hungry man is to serve God. To plant a tree is to worship God. His whole life becomes a sacrifice, an offering to the divine who is manifest everywhere.
These are the three great streams. One suits the man of intellect, another the man of heart, and the third the man of action. Krishna accepts them all. He is saying, "Come to me through whichever door is natural for you. All paths, if followed with sincerity, lead to me."
