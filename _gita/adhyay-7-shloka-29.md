> Those who strive by resorting to Me for becoming free from old age and death, they know Brahman, the individual Self, and all about actions. [They know Brahman as being all the individual entities and all actions. This verse prescribes meditation on the qualified Brahman for aspirants of the middle class. Verses beginning with the 14th speak about the realization of the unqualified Brahman by aspirants of the highest class.]

### Osho’s Commentary
Those who take refuge in Me, seeking freedom from old age and death, they come to know the ultimate reality.
To be free from old age and death does not mean the body will not age or die. It means to realize that which is beyond the body, that which is ageless and deathless.
And one who strives for this, with a deep surrender to the divine, comes to know three things:
He knows Brahman, the absolute reality.
He knows adhyatman, the whole science of the Self.
And he knows karma, the entire mystery of action.
These three—God, the self, and the world of action—are revealed to the one who walks the path of surrender and seeking.
