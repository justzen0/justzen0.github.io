> Endowed with yoga, pure in mind, controlled in body, a conqueror of the organs, the Self of the selves of all beings—he does not become tainted even while performing actions. When this person resorts to nitya and naimittika rites and duties as a means to the achievement of full illumination, and thus becomes fully enlightened, then, even when he acts through the apparent functions of the mind, organs, etc., he does not become affected.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna paints a portrait of the one who has mastered the yoga of action.
He is yogayukto, yoked to the divine through action.
His soul is pure, vishuddhatma. The dust of desire and ego has been washed away.
He has conquered his own self, vijitatma, and mastered his senses, jitendriyah. He is the master in his own house.
And the culmination: sarvabhutat-mabhutatma. He sees his own Self as the Self in all beings. The illusion of separation has vanished. He sees the divine spark in the saint and the sinner, in the animal and the tree.
For such a person, though he acts, he is not tainted, kurvannapi na lipyate. How can he be tainted? The doer, the separate ego, has dissolved. The divine itself acts through him. His action is no longer personal; it is a cosmic happening. He has become a hollow bamboo, and the song that flows through him is the song of the whole.
