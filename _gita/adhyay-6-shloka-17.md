### Osho’s Commentary
Yoga becomes the destroyer of all sorrow for the one who is balanced in everything—in his food and his recreation, in his actions, in his sleep and his wakefulness.
This is the secret. Life is a rhythm, a dance between opposites. Day and night, work and rest, sound and silence. The one who lives in harmony with this rhythm finds a deep sense of well-being. The one who fights against it creates misery for himself.
We have all become imbalanced. We have lost touch with the natural wisdom of our own bodies. We follow external rules, social conventions, not our own inner needs.
The yogi is one who listens to his own being. He finds his own unique balance. And in that balance, all sorrow dissolves, because sorrow is just a name for a state of inner imbalance, of disease. Yoga is the path to that ultimate health which is holiness.
