### Osho’s Commentary
Now, the three kinds of action.
Sattvic action is your prescribed duty, performed without attachment, without likes or dislikes, and without any desire for the fruit. It is a pure, silent offering.
Rajasic action is performed with great effort, driven by desire and ego. It is a feverish activity, a struggle to achieve something, to prove something.
And tamasic action is undertaken out of delusion, without any thought of the consequences, of the harm it may cause to others or to oneself. It is a blind, unconscious, destructive act.
Observe your own actions. Do they flow from a state of quiet centeredness? From a fever of desire? Or from a dark, unconscious stupor? Your actions are the outer expression of your inner world.
