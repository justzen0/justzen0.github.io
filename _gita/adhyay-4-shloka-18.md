> He who finds inaction in action, and action in inaction, is the wise one [possessed of the knowledge of Brahman] among men; they are engaged in yoga and are performers of all actions!

### Osho’s Commentary
Here is the supreme paradox, the ultimate secret. The one who sees inaction while in the midst of action—the one who can be in the marketplace but not of it, who can act totally yet remain a silent witness within—he is the truly wise man.
And the one who sees action in inaction—the one who understands that even sitting silently is a form of doing if the ego is present, that renunciation itself can be a great act of the ego—he too is wise.
Such a man is a buddhiman, an intelligent one. He is a yukta, a true yogi, one who is perfectly balanced. And he is kritsnakarmakrit, the performer of all actions. Why all actions? Because when the ego is not, the divine acts through him. His action is no longer partial, fragmented. The whole of existence flows through him. He has become a hollow bamboo flute, and the song that flows through him is the song of the cosmos itself.
