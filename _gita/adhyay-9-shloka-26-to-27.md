### Osho’s Commentary
It is not what you offer that matters, but how you offer it. A leaf, a flower, a little water—offered with love, with devotion, is accepted by the divine.
The real offering is not of things. The only thing that is truly yours to give is your own sense of doership, your ego. All else—the flowers, the fruits—already belongs to the divine. But the feeling that “I am doing, I am giving,” this is the one thing that man has created. To offer this ego at the feet of the divine is the real sacrifice.
And so, Krishna says, “Whatever you do, Arjuna, do it as an offering to me.” Eating, working, giving, even your austerities—let every act of your life be a sacred ritual, an offering to the supreme.
When you act in this spirit, you are no longer the doer. The divine itself acts through you. The action continues, but it no longer creates any bondage. It becomes a form of worship, a way of communion. To transform every ordinary act of life into a sacred offering is the whole secret of Karma Yoga.
