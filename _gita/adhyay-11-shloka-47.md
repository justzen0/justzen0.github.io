> The Blessed Lord said, Out of grace, O Arjuna, this supreme, radiant, cosmic, infinite, primeval form—which no one other than you has seen before—has been shown to you by Me through the power of My own Yoga.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna says, "By my grace, this supreme form has been shown to you." And it has never been seen by anyone other than you.
This is not a statement of Arjuna's specialness in a historical sense. It means that this vision is a unique, personal revelation. It is not something that can be transferred from one person to another. Each seeker has to have his own direct experience.
The path to the divine is not a public highway. It is a private, inner journey. And the ultimate revelation is a unique and intimate encounter between the individual soul and the universal reality.
