### Osho’s Commentary
These bodies are finite. They belong to the eternal, imperishable soul. Therefore, fight, Arjuna.
After this profound metaphysical discourse, Krishna brings Arjuna back to the immediate reality of the battlefield. He is not teaching a philosophy for escape. He is giving Arjuna a vision that will enable him to act with a new consciousness.
If you know that you are the eternal soul and the body is just a temporary garment, then where is the fear? Where is the grief? You can play your role in the drama of life with freedom, with courage, with a deep sense of peace. The fight is no longer a personal battle of greed and hatred. It becomes a detached, dutiful action performed in the light of ultimate wisdom.
