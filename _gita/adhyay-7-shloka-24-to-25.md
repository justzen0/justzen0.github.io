### Osho’s Commentary
The unintelligent, the abuddhayah, see only my form, my manifestation. They do not see my higher nature, which is unmanifest, eternal.
This is the great difficulty. The divine, when it manifests, has to take on a form, a body. And we are so accustomed to seeing only forms that we miss the formless that is hidden within. We see the body of Krishna, but we miss the boundless consciousness that is expressing itself through that body. We see the jewel, but miss the light that is shining through it.
"I am not revealed to all," says Krishna, "veiled by my yogamaya." This world is a divine play, a magical show. And in this show, the real is hidden behind the apparent. Only those with eyes to see, with a heart to feel, can penetrate this veil and have a glimpse of the unborn, the imperishable reality that is the source of all.
