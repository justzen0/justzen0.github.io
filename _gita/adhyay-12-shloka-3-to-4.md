### Osho’s Commentary
The mind asks for one path, Arjuna. But Krishna says, “They too attain Me.” He does not create a conflict. He knows that both paths, seemingly opposite, reach the same destination.
One is the path of the formless, the nirakar. It is the path of knowing, of jnana. It is a path of emptying. The seeker of the formless has to empty himself of all thoughts, all forms, all images, until only a pure, silent void remains. It is the path of Buddha. He denied God, he denied the soul, he denied everything, just so that you could become a perfect emptiness. And in that emptiness, the divine descends.
The other is the path of the form, the sakar. It is the path of devotion, of bhakti. It is a path of filling. The devotee fills himself so completely with the form of his beloved—with Krishna, with Christ—that his own self disappears. He becomes so full of the other that his own ego has no space left to exist. He sings, he dances, he loves, until only the beloved remains.
These seem to be opposite paths. One is of emptying, the other of filling. But the ultimate result is the same: the dissolution of the ego. Whether you empty the pot completely or fill it to the brim so that it overflows, in both cases, the pot loses its separate identity. And that, my friend, is the whole secret.
