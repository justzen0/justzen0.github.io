Then, having known Me truly, he enters into Me immediately afterward.<br><br>Ever engaging in all actions, one to whom I am the refuge, attains the eternal, immutable state through my grace.<br><br>Mentally surrendering all actions to Me and accepting Me as the supreme, keep your mind ever fixed on Me by resorting to the concentration of your intellect.<br><br>Having your mind fixed on Me, you will cross over all difficulties by My grace. If, however, you do not listen out of egotism, you will be destroyed.

### Osho’s Commentary
Having become one with Brahman, he is serene. He neither grieves nor desires. He is equal to all. And in this state, he attains para-bhakti, the supreme devotion.
Through this supreme love, he knows me in my essence. And knowing me, he enters into me.
This is the ultimate alchemy. The path of knowledge leads to a serene peace. And in that peace, the flower of supreme devotion blossoms. And through that devotion, the final merger happens.
Therefore, says Krishna, offer all your actions to me. Fix your mind on me. With my grace, you will cross over all obstacles. But if, out of your ego, you do not listen, you will be lost.
