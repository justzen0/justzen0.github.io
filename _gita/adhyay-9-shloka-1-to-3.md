> The Blessed Lord said: However, to you who are not given to cavilling, I shall speak of this highest secret itself, which is knowledge combined with experience, by realizing which you shall be free from evil.<br><br>This is the sovereign knowledge, the sovereign profundity, the best sanctifier; directly realizable, righteous, very easy to practice, and imperishable.<br><br>O destroyer of foes, those who are disregarding this Dharma (knowledge of the Self) certainly go round and round, without reaching Me, along the path of transmigration which is fraught with death.

### Osho’s Commentary
There are two ways of looking at life. One is negative, the other is positive. One sees only matter, and nothing more. The other sees only the divine, and nothing else. But the world you see is not the world as it is; it is a reflection of your own eyes. Science thought man could be an objective observer, but now it knows: the observer is always part of the observation. What we see is colored by our own being.
So when the atheist says there is no God, he is only saying, “My vision is such that I cannot see God.” And the devotee who says, “I see God everywhere,” is only saying, “My vision is such that I see only God.”
Krishna begins by telling Arjuna, “Now I can speak this supreme secret to you, because you are a devotee, free from the fault-finding eye.”
What is this fault-finding eye? It is the eye of the ego, the eye of doubt. It is the eye that dissects, that breaks things apart to find the truth, but in the very breaking, the truth is lost. You cannot find the beauty of a flower by tearing its petals apart. You cannot find the soul by dissecting the body.
The eye of the devotee is different. It is an eye of love, of trust. It does not dissect; it embraces. It does not argue; it surrenders. It is a vision that joins, that seeks unity.
For eight long chapters, Krishna has been chipping away at Arjuna’s intellect, at his doubt, at his fault-finding mind. Now, he sees that Arjuna’s heart is open. The questions are no longer from the head, but from a deep thirst. The armor of the ego has been cast aside. And only to such an open, loving, receptive heart can the supreme secret be revealed.
