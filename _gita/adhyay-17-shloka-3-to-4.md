> O scion of the Bharata dynasty, the faith of all beings is in accordance with their minds. This person is composed of faith as the dominant factor. He is indeed what his faith is.<br><br>Those with sattva quality worship the gods; those with rajas, the demigods and demons; and those with tamas, ghosts and hosts of spirits.

### Osho’s Commentary
The faith of a man, my friend, is his very color. It is not something you choose; it arises from the depths of your being. You are what your faith is. Your faith is the mirror in which your true face is reflected.
And so, Krishna says, the worship of a man reveals his inner nature.
The sattvic man, the man of purity and light, worships the gods—the divine beings of light, the symbols of higher consciousness. He is drawn to that which is luminous, peaceful, and harmonious.
The rajasic man, the man of passion and action, worships the Yakshas and Rakshasas—the titans, the forces of power and wealth. His worship is a transaction. It is a desire for more power, more success, more of the world.
And the tamasic man, the man of inertia and darkness, worships the ghosts and spirits of the netherworld. He is drawn to the dark, the unconscious, the destructive.
Look within. Whom do you worship? Not in the temples, but in the temple of your heart. What is your ultimate value? Is it peace? Is it power? Is it darkness? In your answer, you will find the key to your own being. And remember, whatever you worship, you are on the way to becoming that.
