### Osho’s Commentary
A beautiful simile. The mind of the yogi becomes like a lamp in a place where there is no wind. Its flame is unwavering, still, silent.
Our minds are constantly flickering. A thousand thoughts, a thousand desires, are the winds that keep the flame of our consciousness in a constant state of agitation. We are never still, never silent.
The practice of yoga is the practice of creating this inner windless space. Through awareness, through detachment, the winds of thought begin to subside. And in that inner stillness, the light of consciousness shines with a brilliant, unwavering clarity. In that light, all is revealed.
