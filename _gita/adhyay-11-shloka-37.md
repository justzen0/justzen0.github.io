> And why should they not bow down to You, O exalted One, who are greater than all and who are the first Creator even of Brahma! O infinite One, supreme God, Abode of the Universe, You are the Immutable, being and non-being, and that which is Transcendental.

### Osho’s Commentary
Why should they not bow down to you, who are greater even than Brahma, the creator? You are the infinite, the imperishable. You are being (sat), non-being (asat), and that which is beyond both.
Arjuna is now trying to grasp the ultimate reality. It is not just the creator. It is that which is before creation. It is not just that which is, but also that which is not. And it is even that which transcends this duality of being and non-being.
This is the ultimate paradox, which can only be hinted at by words. The supreme reality is a great void, a nothingness, out of which everything arises. It is the silence that is the source of all sound. To know this is to go beyond all the categories of the mind.
