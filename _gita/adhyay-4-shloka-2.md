### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna says this truth was passed down through parampara. This word does not mean a dead tradition, a dusty ritual. It means a living river. The Ganga flows from the Gangotri; it reaches the ocean. The water is ever new, yet the river is ancient. This is parampara—a living continuity.
But this yoga, he says, became lost in the course of time. Not destroyed, mind you, but veiled. How? It is lost in the desert of words. The living experience of a Buddha is captured in words. The words are repeated, scriptures are formed, commentaries are written upon commentaries. Soon, the living truth is buried, and only a mountain of dead words remains. The signpost is worshipped, and the journey is forgotten. The finger pointing to the moon becomes more important than the moon itself.
This is how truth becomes lost. Not because truth disappears, but because man gets entangled in the map and forgets the territory. The river of truth disappears into the sands of scripture.
