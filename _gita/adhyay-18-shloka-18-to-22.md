### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now dissects the anatomy of action and knowing. He says knowledge, the known, and the knower are the impulse. And the instrument, the action, and the agent are the basis.
And all these three—knowledge, action, and the agent—are themselves of three kinds, colored by the three gunas.
Sattvic knowledge is to see the One in the many. To look at this diverse, divided world and to perceive the one, undivided, imperishable reality shining through all forms.
Rajasic knowledge is to see only the many, the separateness. To see the world as a collection of disconnected fragments, and to live in a state of conflict and competition.
And tamasic knowledge is to cling to one small part as if it were the whole. It is the vision of a fanatic, a bigot, who thinks his small, partial truth is the total truth. It is an irrational, narrow, and trivial vision.
Look at your own knowing, my friend. Is it a vision of unity? Of diversity? Or of a narrow, fanatical clinging? In your knowing, you will find the quality of your being.
