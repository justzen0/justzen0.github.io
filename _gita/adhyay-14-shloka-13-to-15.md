> O descendant of the Kuru dynasty, when tamas predominates, these come into being without exception: non-discrimination, inactivity, inadvertence, and delusion.<br><br>When an embodied one undergoes death while sattva is exclusively predominant, then he attains the untainted worlds of those who know the highest (entities).<br><br>When one dies while rajas predominates, they are born among people attached to activity. Similarly, when one dies while tamas predominates, they take birth among the stupid species.

### Osho’s Commentary
When tamas is predominant, a great darkness descends. There is no initiative, no action. The mind is clouded by delusion.
And the state of your consciousness at the moment of death determines your next birth. This is a profound law of karma.
If you die in a state of sattva, in a state of clarity and light, you are born into a higher world, a world of the wise, where your spiritual journey can continue.
If you die in a state of rajas, full of desires and attachment to action, you are reborn among men, where you can continue your feverish activity.
And if you die in a state of tamas, in darkness and unconsciousness, you are born into a lower womb, a life of ignorance and delusion.
The moment of death is a concentration of your entire life. The dominant quality of your life becomes the seed for your future. Therefore, live in such a way that you can die in a state of light, of awareness.
