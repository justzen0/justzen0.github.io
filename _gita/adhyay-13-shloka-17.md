### Osho’s Commentary
It is the Light of all lights, beyond all darkness. The sun gives light, but it also creates shadows. The ultimate light is a light without a shadow. It is pure consciousness.
It is knowledge (jnanam), the object of knowledge (jneyam), and the goal of knowledge (jnanagamyam).
This is the ultimate trinity. In the final state of knowing, the knower, the known, and the process of knowing all merge into one. The observer becomes the observed. And this ultimate reality is not in some distant heaven; it is hridi sarvasya vishthitam, seated in the hearts of all. The temple is within you. The pilgrimage is an inward journey.
