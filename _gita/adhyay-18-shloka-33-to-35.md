> O Partha, the firmness that is unfailing through concentration, with which one restrains the functions of the mind, vital forces, and the organs—that firmness is born of sattva.<br><br>But, O Partha, the steadfastness with which one holds on to righteousness, covetable things, and wealth, desiring their fruits as the occasion for each arises, that steadfastness is born of rajas.<br><br>That firmness is considered to be born of tamas, due to which a person with a corrupt intellect does not give up sleep, fear, sorrow, despondency, as well as sensuality.

### Osho’s Commentary
And now, the three kinds of fortitude, of dhriti.
Sattvic fortitude is the unwavering firmness by which a yogi controls his mind, his life-force, and his senses. It is a serene, one-pointed determination that is focused on the divine.
Rajasic fortitude is the passionate will by which a man holds onto his goals of worldly righteousness, pleasure, and wealth, always attached to the result.
And tamasic fortitude is a foolish obstinacy. It is the stubbornness by which a man clings to his sleep, his fear, his grief, and his pride.
Even fortitude can be a bondage if it is not sattvic. It is only when your will is aligned with the divine will, when your firmness is in the service of your own liberation, that it becomes a true spiritual quality.
