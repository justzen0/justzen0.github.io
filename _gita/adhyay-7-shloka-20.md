### Osho’s Commentary
Those whose knowledge is stolen away by desires, they turn to other gods. Their prayers are not for the ultimate, but for petty, worldly things. And for these petty things, they create petty gods.
Every desire creates its own god. If you want money, you worship Lakshmi. If you want power, you worship some other deity. These gods are just projections of your own desires. They are man-made.
And such a person is constrained by his own nature. He is a prisoner of his own unconscious patterns. He does not have the freedom to choose the highest. His desires pull him towards the lower.
To seek the one, ultimate God requires a letting go of all lesser desires. To hold onto your desires and then to pray is a contradiction. The real prayer begins only when all desiring has ceased.
