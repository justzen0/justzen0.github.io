### Osho’s Commentary
Here, Krishna gives a specific technique of meditation.
Shut out the outer world. Fix your gaze between the eyebrows, at the third eye center. Equalize the incoming and outgoing breath, so that a balance is achieved.
When the senses, mind, and intellect are thus controlled, and one is free from the inner turmoil of desire, fear, and anger, with his whole being focused on liberation—such a person is already free.
This is a scientific method for turning the consciousness inwards. When the outer distractions are cut off and the breath is balanced, the mind naturally becomes silent. In that silence, the doors to the inner world open, and one discovers the eternal freedom that is one’s own true nature.
