> Those who partake of the nectar left over after a sacrifice reach the eternal Brahman. This world ceases to exist for one who does not perform sacrifices; what, then, to speak of the other world, O best among the Kurus (Arjuna)!

### Osho’s Commentary
Those who partake of the nectar, the amrita, left over from the sacrifice, they attain the eternal.
What is this "remnant of sacrifice"? It means one who lives a life of giving. He shares what he has first, and only partakes of what is left. He lives for the whole, not for himself. The fragrance of such a life is the nectar of immortality.
But for the one who performs no sacrifice, the ayajnasya—the one who lives only for himself, who hoards, who never gives—for him, says Krishna, even this world is not a place of joy. How can he hope for any other world?
The man who cannot share lives in a prison of his own making. He is closed, miserly, and miserable. Even the small joys of this world are denied to him, because all joy comes from opening, from sharing, from connecting. A life without sacrifice is a life without love, without celebration. It is a living death.
