### Osho’s Commentary
Sanjaya concludes his narration. He says, “Thus have I heard this wondrous dialogue, which caused my hair to stand on end. By the grace of Vyasa, I have heard this supreme, secret yoga directly from Krishna, the Lord of Yoga himself.”
Remembering this holy dialogue, he rejoices again and again. Remembering that wondrous form of Hari, he is filled with great wonder.
And his final conclusion is the very essence of the Gita.
Yatra yogeshvarah krishno yatra partho dhanur-dharah
Tatra shrir vijayo bhutir dhruva nitir matir mama
“Wherever there is Krishna, the Lord of Yoga, and wherever there is Arjuna, the wielder of the bow, there will surely be splendor, victory, prosperity, and unwavering righteousness. This is my firm conviction.”
This is not just a prophecy about a historical battle. It is an eternal truth. Wherever there is the divine consciousness (Krishna) and the perfected human action (Arjuna), wherever there is grace and effort, wherever there is surrender and courage—there, victory is certain. This is the ultimate promise. The divine and the human, when they meet in a dance of love and trust, create a life of victory, of prosperity, of eternal dharma. This is the final, glorious message of the song of God.
