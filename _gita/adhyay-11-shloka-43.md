> You are the Father of all beings, both moving and non-moving; to You, the Teacher, are they worthy of worship, and You are greater than a teacher. There is none equal to You; how can there be anyone greater even in all the three worlds, O You of unrivaled power?

### Osho’s Commentary
You are the father of the world, the one to be worshipped, the greatest of all teachers. No one is equal to you; how can anyone be greater?
Arjuna's praise continues. He is trying to bridge the gap that he now feels between himself and Krishna. The friend has disappeared, and in his place stands the supreme Lord of the universe.
This is the transformation of a relationship. What was once a horizontal relationship between two friends has now become a vertical relationship between a humble devotee and the supreme divine.
