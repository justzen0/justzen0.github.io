### Osho’s Commentary
The supreme yogi is one who sees with the eye of sameness, through comparison with his own self.
What does this mean? It means he feels the joy of others as his own joy, and the pain of others as his own pain. The barrier of the ego has completely dissolved. His heart has become one with all hearts.
This is the state of ultimate compassion, of universal love. He no longer lives as a separate island, but as a part of the great continent of humanity, of all existence. He is the one who has truly understood the meaning of empathy. Such a man is the highest of all yogis.
