> Arjuna said, "O Janardana (Krishna), if it is Your opinion that wisdom is superior to action, why do You urge me to take such horrible action, O Kesava?"

### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna’s question arises, but is it a true question? Or is it a shield for his fear? He says, “If knowledge is supreme, O Krishna, why push me into this terrible action?”
Look at the cunning of the mind. It uses the highest truths to justify the lowest escapes. Arjuna is not a seeker of knowledge at this moment. If he were, he would not need to ask. He would simply drop his bow, his arrows, his everything, and walk into the forest of knowing. But no, he stands on the battlefield, trembling, and uses philosophy as an excuse.
In this world, there have always been two streams of thought, like two great rivers flowing to the same ocean. One is Sankhya, the path of knowledge. It says that truth is already within you. You have not lost it, you have only forgotten it. Just remembering is enough. No action is needed. Light a lamp, and the darkness is gone. Know the truth, and ignorance vanishes.
The other stream is Yoga, the path of action, of effort. It says that ignorance is not just darkness; it is like chains around you. It is not enough to remember your freedom. You must break the chains, you must act, you must do something to cut the ropes.
Krishna has spoken to Arjuna of Sankhya, of the ultimate wisdom. And now Arjuna, in his fear, clings to this philosophy. He says, “Wonderful! If knowledge is enough, let me go and seek knowledge. Why this violence? Why this war?”
His emphasis is not on attaining knowledge, but on escaping action. Do you see the trick? The mind is a master deceiver. It will use even God as an excuse to avoid its own transformation. Arjuna is not ready for the truth of Sankhya. He is using it as a beautiful rationalization for his fear. And Krishna, who can see into the very heart of his being, knows this perfectly well.
