### Osho’s Commentary
And now Krishna says, “That same ancient truth, I now declare to you, Arjuna.” Why to Arjuna? “Because you are my devotee, my friend.”
Truth cannot be spoken to an enemy. Truth cannot be revealed to a mind that is closed, argumentative, and filled with doubt. For truth to be transmitted, a deep intimacy is needed, a space of love and trust. When you are with a friend, you are unguarded. Your doors are open. Your armor is cast aside. In that moment of vulnerability, in that space of loving receptivity, the supreme secret can be whispered.
It is not a condition on Krishna’s part. It is a simple statement of fact. The sun may be shining, but if your doors and windows are bolted shut, how can the light enter? Friendship, devotion—these are ways of opening the doors of the heart. Krishna is ready to speak, but are you ready to listen? The whole journey depends on this readiness, this intimate opening.
