> Thus, you will become free from bondage in the form of actions which are productive of good and bad results. Having your mind imbued with the yoga of renunciation and becoming free, you will attain Me.

### Osho’s Commentary
When you offer all your actions to the divine, you are freed from their results, whether good or evil.
The ordinary man is bound by both. Good actions lead to heaven, bad actions to hell. But both are prisons within the cycle of time. The yogi seeks a freedom that is beyond both good and evil, beyond all duality.
By practicing this yoga of renunciation—not renunciation of action, but renunciation of the doer in action—you become liberated. And being liberated, you come to me.
This is the ultimate promise. Not a heaven of pleasure, but a merging with the supreme reality itself. Not a reward for your actions, but a freedom from the very cycle of action and reaction. This is the supreme liberation, the ultimate goal.
