### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna says, “Yes, I will tell you, but only the chief of my glories, for there is no end to them.”
This is not a map of the universe in its entirety. That is impossible. It is a map of hints, of indications. Krishna is choosing symbols that Arjuna can understand, symbols that can act as a bridge.
He begins with the most profound: “I am the Self, seated in the hearts of all beings.”
This is the first and the last truth. All other glories are just manifestations of this one reality. Our bodies are different, our minds are different, but the innermost consciousness is one. We are like bulbs of different colors and shapes, but the electricity that flows through them is the same. That one, universal consciousness is the divine.
Then he says, “I am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all beings.” He is not just a distant creator who set the world in motion and then retired. He is the immanent reality, present in every moment of existence—in its birth, in its life, and in its death.
Then he gives a series of symbols. “Of the Adityas, I am Vishnu.” Vishnu is the sustainer, the preserver. He is the central principle of life. “Of the lights, I am the sun.” The sun is the source of all light, all life, in our solar system.
“Of the Vedas, I am the Sama Veda.” The Sama Veda is the Veda of music, of song. It is not a book of philosophy, but of poetry, of harmony. Krishna’s own being is more like a song than a doctrine.
“Of the senses, I am the mind.” The senses are separate windows. The mind is the central processing unit that integrates all their perceptions. It is the king of the senses.
“And in all beings, I am the consciousness.” This is the ultimate. Not the body, not the mind, but the pure awareness, the witnessing consciousness—that is the divine spark in all.
