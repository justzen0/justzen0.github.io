> And entering the Earth, I sustain the beings through My power; and nourish all the plants by becoming Soma, which is of the nature of sap.<br><br>Taking the form of Vaisvanara, and residing in the bodies of creatures, I, in association with Prana and Apana, digest the four kinds of food.

### Osho’s Commentary
I enter the earth and support all beings with my energy. I become the moon and nourish all the plants with life-giving nectar. I become the fire of digestion in every living body and transform food into life.
Krishna is revealing himself as the immanent, life-giving principle in all of existence. He is not a distant God sitting on a throne. He is the very process of life itself. He is in the soil, in the plants, in the fire of your own belly.
To eat with this awareness is to turn your food into a sacred offering. To see the divine hand in the simple processes of nature is to live in a world of constant worship, of constant wonder.
