### Osho’s Commentary
If you do not fight this righteous war, then having forsaken your own nature and your honor, you will incur sin. People will speak of your eternal disgrace. And for a man of honor, disgrace is worse than death. They will think you fled from battle out of fear. Your enemies will speak ill of you. What could be more painful than that?
Krishna is now using a different kind of argument. He is speaking to Arjuna’s ego as a warrior, to his sense of honor. He knows that the highest truth may be too subtle for Arjuna’s agitated mind. So he uses arguments that Arjuna can understand.
He is like a skilled physician who uses different medicines for different stages of a disease. First, he gave the medicine of the highest wisdom. Now, he is giving the more practical medicine of social honor and duty. The goal is the same: to bring Arjuna back to a state of action, of balance, of alignment with his own nature.
