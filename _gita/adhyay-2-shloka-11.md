### Osho’s Commentary
And now, Krishna speaks. And his first words are not a balm, but a sword. He does not offer sympathy. He says, “You grieve for that which is not worthy of grief, yet you speak words of wisdom.”
He is separating Arjuna from his arguments. He is saying, “Your words are beautiful, Arjuna, they sound very wise. But you are a fool. You are grieving for an illusion.” He is driving a wedge between Arjuna’s intellect and his being.
The wise, he says, grieve neither for the living nor for the dead. Why? Because they know that life and death are just two sides of the same game. They are appearances, dreams. The one who is truly real, the Self, is never born and never dies. To grieve for the changing forms is to be ignorant of the unchanging reality. Krishna’s first teaching is a direct blow to Arjuna’s identification with the world of appearances.
