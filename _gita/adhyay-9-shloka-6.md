> Understand thus that just as the voluminous wind, moving everywhere, is ever present in space, similarly all beings abide in Me.

### Osho’s Commentary
The wind blows everywhere, restless, powerful. It moves through the trees, across the mountains, over the oceans. But where does it rest? It rests in space, in the ether, akasha. Space is its home. It is born of space, it moves in space, it dissolves into space. Space holds it, yet space is untouched by it. The storm comes and goes, but the silence of space remains.
Krishna says, “In the same way, Arjuna, know that all beings rest in Me.”
We are like that wind. We are born, we live, we struggle, we love, we die. We are full of turmoil, of passion, of endless movement. But all this movement is happening within a vast, silent, unmoving consciousness. We are held in the embrace of the divine, just as the wind is held in the embrace of the sky. We cannot exist without it, yet it remains utterly untouched by our small dramas. To realize this is to find the ultimate ground of one’s being.
