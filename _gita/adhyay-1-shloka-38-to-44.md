### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna’s arguments become more and more elaborate. He says, “They may be blinded by greed, but we can see the evil in destroying a family. With the destruction of the family, the ancient family traditions perish. With the loss of tradition, lawlessness prevails. The women of the family become corrupt, and from this, a confusion of castes arises. This leads the family and the destroyers of the family to hell. The rites offered to the ancestors cease, and the ancestors fall.”
These are all borrowed arguments, my friend. These are the arguments of the priests, the arguments of a tradition-bound society. Arjuna is not speaking from his own experience. He is repeating what he has heard. He is using the fear of hell, the fear of social chaos, the fear of disrupting tradition, as a shield for his own personal unwillingness to fight.
The mind is a master deceiver. When it wants to escape from a situation, it will find the most noble-sounding reasons. It will speak of dharma, of tradition, of the welfare of society. But behind all these beautiful words, the real motive is a simple, personal fear, a simple personal attachment. Krishna is listening to all this, and he is smiling, because he can see the man behind the mask of the philosopher.
