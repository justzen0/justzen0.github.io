> Since the soul is seated in Nature, therefore it experiences the qualities born of Nature. Contact with the qualities is the cause of its births in good and evil wombs.

### Osho’s Commentary
This Purusha within the body has many names, depending on its state of consciousness.
It is the upadrashta, the witness, the spectator. This is its purest state.
It is the anumanta, the permitter. When it identifies a little, it gives its consent to the actions of nature.
It is the bharta, the supporter.
It is the bhokta, the experiencer, when it gets fully entangled in pleasure and pain.
It is the Maheshvara, the great Lord, when it realizes its mastery over nature.
And it is the Paramatman, the Supreme Self, when it realizes its oneness with the whole.
These are not different entities. They are different stages of the unfolding of the one, same consciousness, from a passive witness to the supreme Lord of all.
