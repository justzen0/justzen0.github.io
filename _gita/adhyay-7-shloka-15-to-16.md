> The foolish evildoers, who are the most depraved among men, who are deprived of their wisdom by Maya, and who resort to demonic ways, do not take refuge in Me.<br><br>O Arjuna, foremost of the Bharata dynasty, four classes of people of virtuous deeds adore Me: the afflicted, the seekers of Knowledge, the seekers of wealth, and the man of Knowledge.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna makes a clear division. There are those who, deluded by ignorance, live a life of evil. They are mudhah, fools. Not because they are unintelligent, but because they are living against their own ultimate good. They are like a man sitting on a branch and cutting the very branch he is sitting on. Their knowledge is stolen by illusion, and they live in a demonic state of being. They never turn towards the divine.
Then there are the four types of virtuous men who do turn towards me.
Arto, the distressed. Those who are in pain, in suffering, and call out for help.
Artharthi, the seeker of wealth. Those who desire worldly things and pray for them.
Jijnasu, the seeker of knowledge. The philosopher, the one who is curious about the nature of reality.
And Jnani, the wise. The one who seeks not for relief from pain, nor for wealth, nor for intellectual answers, but for the ultimate liberation itself. He seeks God for God’s own sake.
Krishna accepts all four. He does not condemn those who come out of pain or desire. He knows that these can be the first steps on a long journey. Any reason that brings you to the door of the temple is a good reason. But the highest is the jnani, the one who comes out of pure love.
