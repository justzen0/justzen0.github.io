> He who has conquered his own self by the self, his self is his own friend. But for one who has not conquered his own self, his self itself acts like an enemy.

### Osho’s Commentary
He who has conquered himself is his own friend. And for the unconquered one, his very own self behaves as an enemy.
Gurdjieff used to say that man is not one, he is a crowd. We are like a big mansion in which the master is absent, and all the servants are claiming to be the master. The eyes say, “I am the master.” The stomach says, “I am the master.” And there is a constant conflict. We are a house divided against itself.
To conquer the self means to awaken the true master. The moment the master appears, all the servants fall into line. A great harmony is born. The senses, which were once enemies pulling you in different directions, now become friends, instruments of a single, integrated will.
This inner integration is the whole art of yoga. When you are one, you are a friend to yourself. When you are a crowd, you are your own worst enemy.
