### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna now speaks of the two paths of departure, using very symbolic language. These are not about astronomical times, but about inner states of consciousness.
There is a path of no-return, and a path of return.
The path of no-return is described with symbols of light: fire (agni), flame (jyoti), day (ahah), the bright fortnight of the moon (shuklah), and the six months of the sun’s northern course (uttarayanam).
What do these mean? These are all symbols for a consciousness that is moving upwards, towards more light, more awareness.
Agni, fire, is the energy of passion transformed into a quest for truth.
Jyoti, flame, is when this energy becomes a clear, unwavering light.
Aha, day, is the state of total wakefulness, free from the darkness of ignorance.
Shukla, the bright fortnight, symbolizes the waxing moon, a consciousness that is constantly growing towards fullness.
And Uttarayanam, the northern path, symbolizes the upward movement of the life-energy, from the lower centers to the highest, from the earth to the sky.
The yogi whose consciousness departs in this state of ascending light, he merges with the ultimate light, Brahman. He does not return.
