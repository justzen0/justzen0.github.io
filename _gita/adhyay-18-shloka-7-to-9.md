### Osho’s Commentary
What is this prescribed action, this niyat karma? It is that which must be done. To abandon it out of delusion is tamasic. It is to fall into inertia, into darkness.
And he who abandons action because it is painful, out of fear of bodily discomfort—his abandonment is rajasic. He does not gain the fruit of true renunciation. He is simply running away from pain. His focus is still on the body, on comfort.
But the one who performs his duty simply because it ought to be done, without any attachment, without any thought of the fruit—his is the true, sattvic abandonment.
The world, my friend, is a great stage. You have been given a role to play. To play it with your whole heart, with your whole being, but to remember always that you are just an actor and this is just a play—this is the secret. The sattvic man acts with this awareness. He is in the drama, but he is not of it.
