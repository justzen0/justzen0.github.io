### Osho’s Commentary
I wish to see you again in your familiar four-armed form. O you of a thousand arms, please return to that form.
Arjuna is pleading for a return to the known. The vision of the infinite, the thousand-armed form, has been too much for him.
This is the eternal dilemma of the seeker. We long for the infinite, but we are comfortable only with the finite. We seek the formless, but we can only relate to forms. The path of devotion is a way of bridging this gap. It allows us to relate to the infinite through a finite, personal form, until we are ready to take the final leap into the formless.
