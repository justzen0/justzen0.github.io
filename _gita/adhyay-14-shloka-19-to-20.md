### Osho’s Commentary
And now, the way of transcendence. When the seer, the witness, sees that there is no other doer than the gunas—that it is just nature acting, just the play of these three qualities—and when he knows that which is beyond the gunas, he attains to my being.
This is the ultimate secret. You are not the doer. The body, the mind, the senses—they are all instruments of the gunas. They act. You are the silent watcher, the pure consciousness that is untouched by their play.
When you have this vision, you are no longer identified with the actions of the body and mind. You have stepped out of the drama. And having transcended these three gunas, you are freed from birth, death, old age, and sorrow. You taste the nectar of immortality, amritam.
