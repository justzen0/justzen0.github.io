> Those persons who, becoming non-different from Me and meditating, worship Me everywhere, for them, who are ever attached to Me, I arrange for securing what they lack and preserving what they have.

### Osho’s Commentary
And now, the other way. The way of the one who seeks not for any result, but for the divine itself.
Those who think of me with a mind that is ananya, with no other. Their devotion is one-pointed. Their love is total. They are not using me as a means to some other end. I myself am their ultimate end.
For such devotees, who are ever-yoked to me, I myself take care of their yoga-kshemam. Yoga means attaining that which they do not have. Kshemam means preserving that which they already have.
This is a profound statement of grace. For the one who has completely surrendered, who has dropped all his own efforts and anxieties, the divine itself takes over. He no longer has to worry about his spiritual progress or his well-being. The whole of existence begins to support him.
This is the path of selfless love. It is to be so lost in the divine that you forget your own small needs. And in that very forgetting, everything is provided. When you seek first the kingdom of God, all else is added unto you.
