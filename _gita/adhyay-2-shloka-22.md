> As after rejecting worn-out clothes, a man takes up other new ones, likewise, after rejecting worn-out bodies, the embodied one unites with other new ones.

### Osho’s Commentary
A beautiful and simple analogy. Death is like changing old clothes for new ones. The wearer of the clothes remains the same.
We are so identified with our clothes, with our bodies. We think, "This is me." And when the clothes become old and torn, we are terrified. But the wise man knows that he is not the garment. He is the eternal consciousness that wears many garments in its long journey. For him, death is not a tragedy, but a simple, natural process of renewal.
