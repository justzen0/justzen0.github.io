> Not by the study of the Vedas and sacrifices, not by gifts, not even by rituals, nor by severe austerities, can I, in this form, be perceived in the human world by anyone other than you, O most valiant among the Kurus, who has not received My grace.

### Osho’s Commentary
This form cannot be seen through the study of scriptures, through rituals, through charity, or through severe austerities.
Krishna is making it clear that the ultimate reality cannot be attained through any external means. The Vedas can give you knowledge about the truth, but they cannot give you the truth itself. Rituals can purify the mind, but they cannot reveal the divine.
The ultimate vision is not a result of anything you do. It is a happening of grace, which comes only when you are in a state of total surrender, of deep love and receptivity. All your efforts can only prepare you, make you ready. But the final revelation is a gift.
