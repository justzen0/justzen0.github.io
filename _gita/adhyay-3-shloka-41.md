### Osho’s Commentary
And now, the clarion call to action. “Therefore, Arjuna, first control the senses.”
This is the first step. The senses are the gateways through which the world enters. If the gateways are unguarded, the enemy will have free access. To control the senses does not mean to suppress them, but to become their master. To use them with awareness, not to be used by them unconsciously.
And then, Krishna says, “Slay this sinner,”—papmanam prajahi. This sinner is desire, which is the destroyer of jnana and vijnana.
What is the difference between jnana and vijnana? Jnana is knowledge, intellectual understanding. Vijnana is wisdom, experiential realization. Desire destroys both. It clouds the intellect, so you cannot see clearly. And it pulls the consciousness outwards, so you cannot experience the inner truth.
To slay desire does not mean to kill it with violence. It means to transform its energy. It is like a martial art where you do not fight the opponent’s energy but use it to your own advantage. The energy of desire is immense. When it is turned inwards through meditation and awareness, it becomes the very force that leads to enlightenment.
