### Osho’s Commentary
Rajas, my friend, is born of thirst, of desire. It binds you through the fever of action. The rajasic man is always doing, always running, always trying to achieve something in the future. He can never be here and now. His life is a constant race, and in this race, he forgets himself completely. Action becomes an obsession, a drug. The fruit of rajas is pain, because desire can never be fulfilled.
Tamas is born of ignorance. It binds you through laziness, through sleep, through a dull, unconscious state of being. The tamasic man is asleep. He lives in a kind of stupor. He is not really alive; he is just dragging his existence. The fruit of tamas is ignorance.
So, sattva attaches you to happiness, rajas attaches you to action, and tamas attaches you to delusion. These are the three prisons. And a man is a strange mixture of all three. One guna may be dominant, but the other two are always present, waiting for their chance. This is the inner conflict, the inner madness of man.
