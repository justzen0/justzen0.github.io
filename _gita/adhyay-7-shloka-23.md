### Osho’s Commentary
The fruit gained by such people of small intelligence, alpamedhasam, is temporary, antavat. It has an end.
All worldly pleasures are fleeting. They come and go like waves. They cannot give you lasting satisfaction.
The worshippers of the gods go to the gods. Whatever you worship, you become. If you worship money, your soul becomes metallic. If you worship power, you become hard and cruel. But my devotees, says Krishna, come to Me.
To worship the divine is to be transformed into the divine. To love the eternal is to become eternal. The choice is yours. You can chase the fleeting shadows, or you can turn towards the eternal sun.
