### Osho’s Commentary
A tremendously compassionate statement. Krishna does not condemn even those who worship lesser gods out of desire. He says, “Whatever form a devotee wishes to worship with faith, I make that faith of his firm.”
This is the positive approach. Instead of telling him, “Your God is false, your desire is wrong,” which would only create conflict and doubt, Krishna strengthens his faith.
Why? Because faith itself has a transformative power. Even if the object of faith is an illusion, the act of faith is real. And it is from this faith that he receives his desires—but they are granted, says Krishna, by Me alone. All power, all energy, flows from the one source. The lesser gods are just channels, post offices. The ultimate source is one.
Krishna’s method is to give the man what he desires, so that through experience, he may come to see its futility. He gives him the rope, knowing that sooner or later, he will get tired of the game and begin to seek that which is real.
