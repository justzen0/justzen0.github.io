### Osho’s Commentary
From the very moment of birth, all beings are caught in the delusion of duality, dvandva-mohena. This duality is born of desire (ichha) and aversion (dvesha).
The mind is a constant pendulum swinging between these two poles: "I like this," "I dislike that." This is the fundamental ignorance, the root of all suffering.
But those whose sin has come to an end—and sin is nothing but this state of being caught in duality—those whose actions have become virtuous, they are freed from this delusion. And freed from this, they worship me with a firm resolve.
The path is to become a witness to this inner play of opposites. To watch the desire arise, to watch the aversion arise, and to not be identified with either. In that space of pure witnessing, the delusion is broken, and the path to the divine opens.
