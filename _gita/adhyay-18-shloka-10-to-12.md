> The man of renunciation, imbued with sattva, wise and free from doubts, does not hate unbecoming action, nor does he become attached to becoming activity.<br><br>Since it is not possible for one who holds onto a body to give up actions entirely, therefore he who renounces the results of his actions is called a man of renunciation.<br><br>The threefold results of actions—the undesirable, the desirable, and the mixed—accrue after death to those who do not resort to renunciation, but never to those who resort to renunciation.

### Osho’s Commentary
The true renouncer, the one filled with sattva, his doubts are gone. He does not hate that which is unpleasant, nor does he cling to that which is pleasant. He has become a man of equanimity.
And Krishna makes it absolutely clear: it is impossible for an embodied being to abandon action completely. Life is action. To breathe is an action. The one who tries to escape action is a hypocrite. The real renouncer is the one who renounces the fruit of action.
The fruits are of three kinds: pleasant, unpleasant, and mixed. These fruits bind the one who is attached to them, even after death. But for the true renouncer, the sannyasin who has dropped the desire for the fruit, there is no bondage. His action is pure. It leaves no trace. It is like a bird flying through the sky, leaving no footprints.
