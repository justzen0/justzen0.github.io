### Osho’s Commentary
More details of the posture. The body, head, and neck should be held straight. When the spine is erect, it is easier for the inner energy to move upwards.
Gazing at the tip of the nose. This is a technique to still the eyes. When the eyes are still, the mind becomes still. This gaze also helps to focus the energy at the third eye center, between the eyebrows, which is a gateway to higher consciousness.
With a serene soul, fearless, firm in the vow of brahmacharya. Brahmacharya does not just mean celibacy. It means the conservation of all energies. All the senses are doorways through which our life force flows out. To be a brahmachari is to turn this flow inwards.
And finally, with the mind controlled, thinking of Me, focused on Me. All these techniques are just preparations. The final step is a surrender, a tuning in to the divine. When the instrument is ready, the divine music can begin to flow.
