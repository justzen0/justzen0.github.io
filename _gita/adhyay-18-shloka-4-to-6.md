> O the most excellent among the descendants of Bharata, hear from Me the firm conclusion regarding that tyaga. For, O greatest among men, tyaga has been clearly declared to be of three kinds.<br><br>The practice of sacrifice, charity, and austerity should not be abandoned; it should certainly be undertaken. Sacrifice, charity, and austerity are indeed the purifiers of the wise.<br><br>But even these actions must be undertaken by renouncing attachment and hankering for results. This is My firm and definitive conclusion, O Partha.

### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna says, “Listen now to my nishchay,” my certainty. This is not the conclusion of an intellectual, my friend. That is a temporary thing, shaken by the next argument. This is the certainty born of seeing, of self-realization.
He says abandonment (tyaga) is of three kinds: sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic.
The tamasic man renounces out of laziness. He wants to do nothing, and renunciation becomes a beautiful excuse.
The rajasic man renounces out of ego, out of passion. He makes a great show of his austerity, torturing his body, but it is just another ego-trip. He is still the doer.
But the sattvic man renounces out of understanding. His renunciation is a flowering of his consciousness.
And Krishna makes it clear: the sacred acts of sacrifice, charity, and austerity must not be abandoned. They are purifiers. But even these, he says, must be performed without attachment and without desire for the fruit. This is his supreme, settled conviction.
This is the very essence of his path. Do not run away from life. Do not abandon action. Simply abandon the actor, the ego, who is always looking for a reward. Act with love, with totality, and let the action itself be its own reward.
