> Arjuna said, "O Hrsikesa, it is proper that the world be delighted and attracted by Your praise; that the Raksasas, stricken with fear, run in all directions; and that all the groups of the Siddhas bow down to You."

### Osho’s Commentary
Arjuna now sees the rightness of it all. It is fitting that the world rejoices in the divine. The righteous are delighted, and the demonic are terrified. The perfected ones bow down.
He is seeing the cosmic order. The divine is the center, and everything finds its right place in relation to that center. Those who are in tune with it rejoice. Those who are against it are filled with fear.
This is the law of karma. Your own inner state determines how you experience the world. If you are in harmony with the divine, the world is a source of joy. If you are in disharmony, it is a source of fear.
