> Though I am birthless and undecaying by nature, and the Lord of beings, yet by subjugating My Prakriti, I take birth through My own Maya.

### Osho’s Commentary
A profound secret is being revealed here—the secret of the avatara, the divine incarnation. Krishna says, “I am unborn, Ajo, imperishable, Avyayatma.” How, then, does he take birth?
He says, sambhavami atmamayaya—I come into being through my own maya, my own divine magic.
For the ordinary man, birth is a compulsion. It is the result of past desires, past karmas. He is dragged into the womb, hypnotized by his own unconscious longings. He is a slave.
For an awakened one like Krishna, birth is a choice. It is a conscious descent. He is not compelled by any desire. He comes out of compassion. He assumes a body as a master, through his own power, his own yogamaya. It is a conscious act of self-hypnosis. He enters the body, but he remains the master of the house. He is in the world, but not of it. An ordinary man is born; an avatara descends. This is the whole difference. It is not an act of necessity, but a play of grace.
