### Osho’s Commentary
Krishna maps the cosmos, within and without.
Adhibhuta, he says, is the perishable nature. It is all that which is born and will die. It is matter, the physical world. For the materialist, this is all there is. But for Krishna, this is just the outermost layer, the skin of reality.
Then there is Adhidaivata, the divine principle. And that, he says, is the Purusha. The word Purusha means that which dwells in the city (puri). This body is a city, a metropolis of matter. But within this city dwells a consciousness, a witness, that is not part of the city. That pure consciousness is the divine principle, the Adhidaivata. Matter is asleep; consciousness is awake. Matter is a thing; consciousness is a presence.
And then, the most profound declaration: Adhiyajno'ham evatra dehe—"I myself am the Adhiyajna in this body." The ultimate sacrifice, the ultimate worship, is Me, right here in this body.
What does he mean? The body is the physical, the Adhibhuta. The witnessing consciousness within is the divine, the Adhidaivata. But there is a third reality, deeper than both. That which is a witness even to the witness. That which is the fire of life itself, the ultimate source. That, says Krishna, is Me. It is the very heart of existence, the ultimate sacrifice that is constantly happening within you.
And when he addresses Arjuna as "O best of the embodied," he is not just flattering him. He is pointing to a possibility. He is saying, "Arjuna, in this moment of listening, in this proximity to me, your body has become a temple. You are no longer just an ordinary embodied being. You have become the best, because you are on the verge of realizing the divine within."
