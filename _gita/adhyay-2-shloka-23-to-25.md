### Osho’s Commentary
Weapons cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it, water cannot wet it, wind cannot dry it. It is eternal, all-pervading, unmoving, ancient. It is unmanifest, unthinkable, unchanging. Knowing this, Arjuna, you should not grieve.
Krishna is using the most powerful poetic language to describe the nature of the Self. It is beyond all the elements, beyond all change, beyond all thought.
The grief of Arjuna is for the perishable. Krishna is trying to lift his vision to the imperishable. When you know your true nature as this eternal, untouched reality, all grief, which is born of attachment to the changing world, simply dissolves.
