Wubba lubba dub dub.
Life is a series of compromises you make. But that's **OK**.
Don't lose calm. Think clearly. Learn to take decisions that benefit both the players. Engage in a dialogue with yourself. Reflect on questions and write here.
Control your urges.

Be confident in your speech. Learn to argue.
Don't let your emotions rule over you when taking decisions. Think of all ifs & buts, list down advantages and disadvantages. Think critically.
