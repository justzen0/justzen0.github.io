An anthology of love letters that i wrote for her 19th birthday. 

### LETTER 1
My Dearest Joyshanara ,    
A very very happy 19th birthday. Today is all about you, and I hope you spend this day with joy and laughter. The future ahead is waiting for you with countless oppurtunities and adventures. I believe in your dreams and abilities and I wish that you get successful in every aspect of your life.  I wish that you remain as healthy and joyful as you are. Life can sometimes feel boring and monotonous and really long. But there is one thing, and only one thing, that stays with us till our last breath, that is the emotion of  LOVE . The most mysterious of all, and just like love, these letters are also mysterious. Through these pages, I try my best to bring a smile to your face. These letters might be different from the usual love letters, but nevermind, because these are from the depth of my heart.       

With all my love,

### LETTER 2
Dear Joyshanara , or should I just call you Joy? Just like your presence in my life brings so much joy and pleasure to my heart.Oh, GOD, why is ‚ÄúLikhe jo khat tujhe‚Äù being played in my mind? Am I being too dramatic ? Maybe Yes or Maybe No .              
This is the beautiful absurdity of Life making us ponder over questions with no definitive answers.Speaking of questions, I find myself intrigued by the question ‚ÄúWhat is Love?‚Äù When I say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, What does it truly mean? Love can be due to evolution or it can possess a deeper essence, but LOVE is definitely ‚Äúirrational‚Äù. But that is precisely what makes it so fascinating and enchanting, love is not robotic and predictable, it is the inexplicable dance of hearts.       
P.S. I have no intention to make these letters philosophical but I can't help myself.Please bear with me      
With all my love,

### LETTER 3
Dear Joy,         
The beauty of love is that it is inexplicable. It is an intoxicating blend of EMOTIONS and FEELINGS and URGES that makes our hearts race and drives us crazy .Just like when I see you coming through the library door.       
We share laughter at the silliest things, whether we‚Äôre having fun together or going through mutual disagreements.         
Each day with you is a journey of love, and I‚Äôm grateful for every twist and turn it takes. YES, my every moment with you is full of happiness,full of pleasure and full of LOVE.       
Love is like going into the depths of philosophy. The more we explore its intricacies, the fewer answers we find, but we discover the profound understanding of ourselves.

### LETTER 4
Do I love you? yes .      
Do I love you? yeS.      
Do I love you? Definitely fuckin‚Äô YES .      
With every fiber of my being and with every bit of my soul (keeping the mind-body duality aside, I just wanted to feel like a lover) I love you deeply and passionately.      
I can‚Äôt pray but my deepest wish is to spend each passing second of my life in your company. Being with you brings me immeasurable joy and peace.     
 
Your cute little cheeks,     
Your beautiful shiny eyes,     
The bright red color of your love ,     
Into which my heart lies.

### LETTER 5
Our love is unique and precious, it is love that is platonic, unconditional and strong as the bond between two close friends.       
I may not be as genius as Beethoven crafting a masterpiece like F√ºr Elise , But I can BLEED love through my pen. Maybe you find my love very different and unique. It may be different from what you‚Äôve known before , But it is an expression of my authentic self  from the depth of my heart.       
Shakespeare once wrote ‚ÄúLife is full of sound and fury signifying nothing‚Äù , He perhaps meant that life can feel meaningless.The meaning of life lies in the futile exercise of finding meaning itself. And you, my love, give meaning to my life in countless ways.       

Forever and always,

As we journey through life, there are moments when we can't help but wonder: are we mere characters in a grand play, unfolding with each passing day? If that were the case, who would be the mastermind behind this intricate story of life?

Our love has the power to transcend the limitations of this world, and it breathes life into our existence. With you, I find solace and purpose, and I'm grateful for the love that makes living worthwhile.        
So let us embrace this enigmatic journey together, hand in hand, knowing that our love will light the way and infuse every chapter of life with meaning and joy.

### LETTER 12
As we look back on our journey together, it's natural to wonder, were we destined to meet? Yet, I believe life is a beautiful tapestry woven by the choices we make. Each decision we take opens up a world of possibilities, and in choosing one path, we also choose to forego others. It's the infinite potential of these decisions that shapes our lives.           
In a world of endless possibilities, we found each other, and our connection is truly special. It's not about destiny but about the beautiful synchronicity of our hearts coming together. Through love, we have discovered a profound way to experience life's journey.         
With you, my love, I cherish every moment, knowing that we have each other to lean on. Our love is the key that unlocks the beauty of life, making it an extraordinary adventure
