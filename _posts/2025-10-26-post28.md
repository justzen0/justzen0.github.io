Does god exist? Since the dawn of humanity, we have asked basically two sets of questions to ourselves. The first set contains all the existential questions: How who am I? & who made all of us? Why we are here? Why is there something rather than nothing? And the other set contains all the ethical questions like what is good? What is Virtue? How to live a good life? How to be good? To answer all these questions we made a hypothesis, an imaginary Figure that provided answers to all these questions. When humanity was and stuck to it's own, it Found a way to slide below some authority Figure and make everything easy. Yes, god exists. It exists in all a way. It exists because we want him to exist. These first set of questions are one by one answered by science and by no means points towards god, and it has taught us that not having answers to questions is not to be ashamed of but, rather creates an urge to seek answers. And what about morality? Well, you don't really need a god to be moral. Morality exists independently of god. And society decides everytime what is right & what is wrong.
