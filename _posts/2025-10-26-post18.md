Do you need this? Content is abundant but time is scarce. Watch how you allocate yourself.
"Pay attention to how you pay your attention". Such a beautiful line.
Knowledge is never less. Use social media as a tool to build yourself towards a better version. Don't let them numb your mind. Till you know it's too late.
Focus on learning. Break Task, take gaps, absorb knowledge.
ALONE - Does it bothers you? - no.
Loneliness is a tool. Use this to rebuild yourself. Think.
