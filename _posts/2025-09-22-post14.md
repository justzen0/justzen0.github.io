“Kasturi kundli base, mrig dhunde ban mahi.
Aise ghat ghat Ram hai, duniya dekhe nahi.”

Kabir was absolutely right. The deer keeps running through the forest searching for the fragrance, not knowing it comes from its own navel. And we keep running through life searching for the divine, not knowing it lies within.

The whole problem begins because we think the supreme is something separate from us — someone sitting far away, someone to be reached. Our mind creates this duality: I am here, God is there, and I have to take steps to reach him.

But how can you move towards something which you already are? Every step you take thinking you are going towards him is actually a step away. Because the moment you start moving, you have already assumed distance. You are like the deer searching for its own fragrance in the forest.

The reality is simple: you are what you are looking for. There is no path to walk, only the dirt to be removed from the mirror so that you can see your own true face clearly.

But this is where humanity went wrong. We dragged the supreme into the world of duality. We made him into a creator, separate from his creation. Then came all the questions: who created God, why good and evil, why heaven and hell? But the supreme is beyond all this. Creation and creator are one. There is no game of opposites there. It is pure existence experiencing itself.

And religion, at its core, was never about rituals or rules. It was about one thing: the annihilation of the ego. To dissolve the “I” so that the non-dual reality can be experienced directly. Every genuine spiritual practice — meditation, prayer, devotion — was only a method to break the ego, to make you empty enough so that the truth can reveal itself.

But somewhere along the way, the methods became the religion. The rules became more important than the experience.

The point is simple: drop the ego. Drop the false sense of separateness. Go beyond the mind and its dualities. Then you will see — the fragrance was always coming from your own being.
