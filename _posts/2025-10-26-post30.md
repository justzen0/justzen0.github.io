Teamwork requires a team to work. And a leader that really knows his stuff. We did everything wrong. We made joke of ourselves.
Well I don't care about that. Team must be built according to the task and people should be chosen on that particular Skillset & requirements.
Whatever happened, at least it taught me something. Don't trust blindly on people. They say something infront of you, then cuss you behind your back. Just get your work done, healthy socialization is Ok, but don't get too attached to anything. 
Be STOIC.
