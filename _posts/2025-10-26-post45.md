What makes us different from other species is our ability to think, creatively and collectively.  
 
That is a power. Thinking and to be able to reflect is a kind of power that help us navigate our own ways. But If comes with very great responsibilities. Life Formed millions of years ago in this planet, and is evolving ever since, As we have the power to think and act consciously, we have a responsibility. We are responsible to think deeply of what we are and what we should do, because we know that able to our conscious decisions we affect not only ourselves but everything and everyone around us, connected with each other in a very complex manner. My point is we must all ask ourselves everytime the two big questions, the existential one of "who we are?". why we are here? and so on, and the moral of "what should we do?" and "How we should act?"
