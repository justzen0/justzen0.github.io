You are responsible for everything that you do. There is no god, no creator outside, who is controlling all of this. & You are solely responsible of what you do to your life. You have to find the meaning, you have to fight alone. Believing in god is childish. Like you scare a child to do good by using imaginary characters. It's the same. God is invented by us. We invented the idea that god invented us. We gave him the powers. When you stand on your feet and understand your responsibilities there is no need to believe in such stories.
Achievement of daily tasks creates good feelings. Reduces stress.
I think the ways I made are working. Adding to it, Discarding something from it, tweaking, that's how it goes.
Death, don't fear it. Don't fear truth. Loneliness is a superpower. Try to be confident, engage more.
Everything that happens, happens for good. It is such a shitty idea. It creates us less responsible, tells us that everything is fine. Just accept it. Don't resent, don't raise voice, everything is fine.
God does everything for good. God has a plan for everything.
FUCK GOD. There is no god. No creator. We are just a bunch of atoms that gained consciousness and believe that we are made by a creator, we just believe, God is just a belief.
