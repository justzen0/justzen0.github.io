Don’t waste time making New Year resolutions.

Not because resolutions are useless—but because **you are clueless about yourself**.

As the year ends, a familiar urge appears: to become better, to add something to life, to cut out what feels unnecessary. You sense that change is needed. But you don’t actually know **what** change is authentic to you. And from this ignorance, you impose borrowed ideas of “self-improvement” on yourself. Superficial expectations. Second-hand discipline.

This is why resolutions fail.

You drift away from them, then comfort yourself with the same lie: *next time*.
But the failure was guaranteed from the start.

Every imposition disguised as discipline is a stain on your existence.
If discipline feels like a sword hanging over your head, you’ve already misunderstood it.

Discipline is not enforcement. It is **intrinsic**.

Every discipline that is taught, preached, or copied stands on a fragile framework. It collapses—because your existence precedes all methods, systems, and ideals. What comes first is the **urge**. The inner burning. Without that fire, no discipline survives.

But when the urge is real, discipline forms on its own. Effortlessly.
It becomes personal, organic, unmistakably yours.

What looks hard to others feels like play to you.

As the Taoists say—flow like water. Not forcing, not resisting. Just moving, making way through everything.

How to recognize your true essence, your real existence—that is a conversation for another day.


End.
