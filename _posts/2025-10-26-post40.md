Do you need fear of good to act good? Do you need bait of heaven and infinite pleasure to act good on earth? What is the condition to act good. I think the reason just this is we give the tempt kids by giving them toffees & chocolates to make them do something.

Religion does the same thing by promising love of god and pleasure in heaven so that we do good. But it is so childish!
I think doing good must be unconditional. Good must be done, because it's good. period. And not because you will get something in afterlife.
