A line from my dream "When you stare in the mirror you see your impression, when you stare long enough, you are able to see yourself". I am not able to fully comprehend it's meaning. But it seemed interesting to me. I somehow forced myself indirectly in my dream to watch it in third person. 

Many people are so addicted to these short form of content and mindless scrolling. It numbs your mind. Focus on art. Focus on great things humanity has made. Focus on great people humanity has produced.
Learn From them. Art is so unique to human, we have the ability to comprehend it. & we should learn it.
Wishing, praying, why? Just an escape and to console yourself that there is someone taking care of them. Whom should I pray to, If there is none? And if there is a god, then who made god? Living organisms are not a result of a creator.
Biology is just chemistry at its finest.

**MEDITATE. DONT STIMULATE YOURSELF WITH THIS DIGITAL NONSENSE.**
