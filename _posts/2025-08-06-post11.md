Have you noticed how time behaves differently depending on your state of mind?
When you are completely present — playing, laughing with friends, doing something you love — time seems to fly. Hours pass like minutes. And the strange thing? You don’t feel drained. Instead, you feel more alive, even rejuvenated.

But the moment your mind is divided — split between the past and the future, thinking, calculating, hesitating — time slows down. Even a few minutes feel like hours. That’s because you're not truly there. You're elsewhere, caught in your thoughts.

This is something I realised during meditation. The way time feels can be a powerful filter to understand where your energy really belongs.

If time flows effortlessly, you're doing something aligned with your being.
If time drags, it's a sign: you're forcing something, out of sync with your true rhythm.

It’s a subtle but profound compass — one that points not north, but inward.
