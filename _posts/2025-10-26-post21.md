Stress induces anxiety, anxiety of not achieving induces anger. You become more stressed. It's a vicious circle. You plan to achieve a certain target. When you are not able it makes you stressed, Stressing over it makes you anxious of what will happen. Your mood swings and you become angry. When anger kicks in rationality goes down. Time is wasted. Nothing is achieved. All you are left with deteriorated mental health. You take suboptimal decisions, social relations get ruined.

How to solve? Realistic goal setting and proper focus, Go as the schedule says, Challenge yourself.
Planning on the day vs. Planning at night. Going to change the way, will be making tomorrow's plan a night before. So that I can just start off the day with work.
You are not working at the optimum level, you are distracted. Reduce your distractions. Do what is meant to be done.

**Focus, Focus, Focus.**

As I always say, life has no meaning, meaning lies within. The only truth is death. What you have is life. Enrich your life with good ideas and values. It's the only thing you have.
