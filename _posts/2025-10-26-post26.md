We don't want money in our life. Money is just an enabler that helps us to practice our freedom and live according to the way we want.
From this freedom and the desire for this freedom comes happiness.
Do things that provide you freedom. Freedom from established institutions.
But this doesn't mean that everything is allowed. The freedom of what you can perform is bound by the moral principles.
So yes money is important. But use it to free yourself. Don't run behind it and the worldly desires to make you trapped, that traps you.
Total lack of conversation from people is not the way. Engage in a dialogue as it is beneficial for both, as they leave with something at the end.
Express yourself, don't fear of being judged. Be lovely & lively. But not at the expense of reason. Everything must be performed according to reason.
