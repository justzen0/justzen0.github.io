I like the feeling of being alone, maybe I'm built this way. I could prefer to be alone my whole life. My dream is to build a small house and a self sustaining organic farm that will provide me food. And be surrounded by books. We are Social animals and need each other. I am not saying about secluding myself from society but instead, being mentally alone with myself. I want to die maybe somewhat around 50 or 55. I don't know why, But just want to.
