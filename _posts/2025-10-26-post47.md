Had my first cigarette yesterday.                
                  
well not technically the first, but first in the sense as I bought it alone and smoked. was the experience worth it. Either good or bad, it was an experience, but I didn't liked it personally. Speaking as an econ, the option has a greater opportunity cost because I could have taken coffee (caffeine) for stimulation rather than having Nicotine. Coolness that comes from smoking cigarettes is not a rational motive. So what did I decide?
That I personally don't like smoking, but in some certain Social Setting I will not refrain myself. And I don't consider it bad. Nothing is bad when done consciously.
Can't be sure if it was due to cigarette or due to the factor that I smoked a cigarette publicly alone and it made an psychological effect of masculinity. But I felt more active and focused.
