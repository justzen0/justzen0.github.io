Every moment you live, there are two roads to choose from. 

One is of pleasure, happiness, laziness, ease. The other one is tough, a path of duties, discipline - A courageous man will always choose the second one. Because he knows that's the only way he can reach his true self. This path is not taken by everyone, but it is the most rewarding.
You are controlled by 2 minds. One wants is hedonistic while the other rational. There remains a constant Fight between these two selves. When you Start listening to your rational self, the other will try its best to lure you into pleasures. You then use your wisdom to calm that voice. Body is designed (mind) in a way that wants pleasure. But you know how to think, so go use that power. Don't let yourself flow into the river of pleasures & in the pursuit of hollow pleasures.
Only you are responsible for whatever you perform. There is no god watching over you. Thus it is your prime duty to use your intelligence in each act you perform.
