Had a very depressing dream today. It taught me something. 
 
"I came out of my examination hall and was asking everyone for getting their passport photo so I can add it to my journal. Well nobody had a second for me. They just left. At the end I was all alone along the river shore".
At the end you will be left alone... This is your fate - You respect others, help others, but they don't give a shit. Don't let this make yourself bad. At the end you are left with yourself. When you are in a dream it feels so real, every word seems so philosophical. I remembered that very supernatural voice of my dream that told me, but after I woke up I just forgot what it was. I am forcing my brain but still can't recall.
"Life's meaning is butter". (I know it sounds funny ) That is what I heard, when I was standing upon the bridge. A beggar proprietor came near me and then I thought what is the difference between me and him. He is financially poor and I am Socially poor. All my life I tried to collect what I could and at the end left alone. At the end I am left with nothing.
