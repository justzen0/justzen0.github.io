"Less is more". Why gaining more information does not necessarily mean that the decision outcome will be good or efficient.    

Because it is really hard to differentiate in a random environment about what data constitutes information and what is noise. So build systems employing the least amount of essential variables, then test your prediction hypothesis, gather results, update the model and go on till you have the efficient and elegant solution to the problem.

Tinkering and messing around, is a way to explore our self. You must not fear to explore, to make and break things, because you don't know what you might step on. Don't confine yourself to comfortable systems and be happy with that, always keep expanding your knowledge.

Human minds find it very hard to comprehend non linear systems. We are build to think linearly. If 'x' and 'y' are correlated then a certain increase/decrease in 'x' will result a corresponding increase/decrease in 'y'. Therefore But the reality is chaotic, it is very hard to model the variables into a linear System. That is why success is not totally dependent on hard work. Yes it plays a role, but it isn't everything. People think that just doing hard work will make you achieve results. It is true in systems like exams but can't be imported into the real world.
