The idea of natural selection and survival of the Fittest isn't just a biological phenomenon. 
It applies to every aspect of life. Society also evolves on this principle. The moral values which are beneficial in some way for the society gets add up and those values that harm Society are left behind. Thus morality is a result of constant iterations and updation of an addition of new values and removal of old ones.
