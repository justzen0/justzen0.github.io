> *"There are three gates leading to this hell – lust (kāma), anger (krodha), and greed (lobha). Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul."*
> **— Bhagavad Gita 16.21**
> {:.featured-quote}

We often imagine *hell* as some far-off, fiery place beneath the Earth — and *heaven* as some perfect realm, filled with perfumed rivers, divine pleasures, and all desires fulfilled.

But this — I feel — is one of the biggest mistakes humanity has made.
We have dragged these beautiful ideas down to fit our childish imagination.
And then, chasing these made-up heavens and running from these invented hells, we commit all kinds of madness.

But to me, **heaven and hell are not physical places** —
they are **mental states**.
They exist *right here*, *right now* — in the mind, in the quality of your awareness.

Whenever you're anxious, greedy, consumed by desire, or burning with anger —

> **You are already in hell.**

Whenever you are centered, still, meditative, present —

> **Heaven is already here.**

And the two aren’t far apart — they’re separated by something incredibly subtle:

> **Awareness.**
> Just a small shift — and hell transforms into heaven.

### 🔥 Step 1: Understand the Three Gates

The *Bhagavad Gita* names **lust (kāma)**, **anger (krodha)**, and **greed (lobha)** as the three gateways to hell.

Let’s look closer:

* **Kāma** — Not just sexual lust, but *craving* of all kinds: for pleasure, recognition, control, status.
* **Krodha** — Not just rage, but the inability to accept reality when things don’t match your expectations.
* **Lobha** — Not just wanting more, but *never* being content. A hunger that doesn’t end.

These are not “sins” — these are states of **unawareness**.

And strangely enough — we inherited these from the jungle.
They were once useful for survival. In that sense, they are gifts — but only if you learn to hold them with awareness.
Handled blindly, they destroy you. Handled wisely, they transform you.

### ⚖️ Step 2: Don’t Suppress, Don’t Surrender — Just Watch

Most people do one of two things when these arise:

1. **Indulgence** — They flow with it. Justify it. Act it out. This is animalistic — reactive, instinctual, unconscious.
2. **Suppression** — They resist it. Force it down. Appear calm on the outside. But inside, the volcano is alive. It just goes into the unconscious and becomes more dangerous.

**Both are wrong.**
They both feed the same fire — one openly, the other secretly.

The middle way is what Buddha called **Majjhimā Paṭipadā** — the *middle path*.
And the key to this path is: **Awareness**.

### 👁️ Step 3: Practice Pure Awareness

Whenever lust, anger, or greed arise — *pause*. Don’t act. Just watch.

* Watch the thought come up.
* Watch your **breathing change**.
* Notice your **heartbeat speeding up**, the **tightness**, the **heat** in the body.
* Observe the emotion without running with it — and without pushing it away.

This is what we call **drashta bhav** — the *state of the watcher*.

There’s a beautiful story Osho told, about **George Gurdjieff**.
When Gurdjieff was 9, his father was dying. He had nothing material to leave behind.
He called his son and said:

> *“I have no wealth to give you, but remember this:
> Whenever someone says something that makes you angry, wait 24 hours before responding.”*

That single lesson changed Gurdjieff’s life.
Because when you don’t react *immediately*, when you observe what’s happening inside you — it loses its grip.

So I say the same:

> Don’t suppress.
> Don’t react.
> **Just watch.**

When you become *fully aware*, the emotion **melts on its own**.
You don’t fall into it. You don’t fake control. You simply *see through it*.

> You step outside and become a witness.

In that awareness:

* You **can’t be angry.**
* You **can’t be consumed by lust.**
* You **can’t be greedy.**

### 🕊️ Step 4: The Gates to Heaven

When you bring awareness to these energies, something alchemical happens.

* **Lust** becomes **creative power**.
* **Anger** becomes **clarity and courage**.
* **Greed** becomes **direction and drive**.

Nothing is to be denied.
Nothing is to be destroyed.

> **Everything can be transformed — through awareness.**

### 🌱 Step 5: Every Gate Is a Stepping Stone

That’s why I say — don’t hate anything within you.
Everything has the potential to evolve you.
Nothing is good or bad by itself. **It’s your relationship with it that defines your growth.**

* Every time lust arises — it’s a doorway back to your inner stillness.
* Every time anger flares up — it’s a mirror to look into.
* Every time greed appears — it’s a challenge to your contentment.

> The gates to hell are real.
> But so is your power to **walk right through them — with awareness**.

And on the other side, is something far more luminous than any fantasy of heaven.
