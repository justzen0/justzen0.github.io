First you have to discover by yourself what really your mind contains.   

You have to first acknowledge all the thoughts and ideas, memories, either good or bad, stored in your mind. And this can only be achieved through meditation, Not the popularised 10 min app version, but, a self talk with yourself with closed eyes. As to reorganise anything you have to first get everything out, meditation and self talk does the same. And yes it is difficult, it is something you can schedule, it is something that takes time, but if done consistently, you will find yourself relieved, more like living in the present and witnessing and observing everything going around. And now when you are at present, build your philosophic base to tackle the upcoming questions. Your philosophy needs to be strong otherwise you will end up again with a cluttered mind. Meditation also helps in this part, is to come up with solutions but you have to also consume new intellectual content, it can be through books, or good videos, podcast, anything.
