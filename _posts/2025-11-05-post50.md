title: "Optionality breeds laziness"

Problem: You think you’re lazy.           
Your assumption: “I’m just not built for that thing.”.          
Actual reason: Too many options.          
Fix: Limit your options with discipline — and you’ll fix your life.

Laziness can only be removed through right discipline, and right discipline can only arise from right reason.        
Discipline born from ego never lasts.       
Right discipline is when consciousness asserts its ownership over the ego.      
It’s the moment you realize: “I am consciousness, not the body, not the mind.”.      
And if that sounds too high for you — fine, do the hard work. Walk the path of karma or bhakti. The point remains: to eradicate laziness, first establish right discipline.      
Now, ask yourself — why do you feel lazy when exams are months away, yet can pull all-nighters right before them?     
Forget spirituality for a moment — this is pure economics.      
You’re lazy because you have options.      
Those options carry an opportunity cost higher than what you’re currently doing.       
When the right option appears — a deadline, an exam, a crisis — your energy instantly aligns.      
That’s why when there are no options, you become unstoppable.     
When you must, you do.               
So, stop being a servant of time.       
Don’t live in such poverty that you need pressure to move.       
Use your own nature as leverage — design your circumstances with limited options and sharp deadlines.      
     
In my case, I follow one principle: either work or nothing.
Work means anything requiring focus — study, chores, reading, thinking.
Nothing means literally nothing — sitting, staring at a wall, watching the breath. No media, no stimulation.          
Why? Because the brain has something called the default mode network — it activates when the mind is at rest. That’s when it digests, connects, and transforms your experiences into insight. Boredom is not the enemy; it’s the forge where clarity is made.
So, reduce your options. Keep only those that come from right discipline.        
Follow them — and productivity will follow you.      

Just like a well-tuned guitar produces melody, a well-disciplined life produces harmony.         
You don’t need to swing between chaos and rigidity.       
Build a discipline that arises naturally from your being —
a state where work feels like play, even though it’s hard work to everyone else.
