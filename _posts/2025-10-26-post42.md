What If our lifespan was limited to certain hours or days. would the existential questions still exist?   

would religions exist? would Philosophy exist? would people still be going out to find a meaning of life? Or will the biological motives, the urge to procreate become prevalent, and our only purpose would be to eat, procreate and die? This is the is a thought experiment, well there is no way to know what is going to happen. We can give reasonable answers based on intellectual guesses.
