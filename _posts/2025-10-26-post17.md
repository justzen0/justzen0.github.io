What is good? What is bad? What are morals?
Nothing happens for good. Nothing happens for bad. Anything that happens, just happens. It is us, who create good and bad out of everything. Objectively, everything is just a cause-effect relationship, differing good and bad helps in proper functioning of our society. What we consider good is greatly dependent on our morals that we have learnt, the religion we follow, the culture in which we live, the ideas to which we conform. Our judgment is based totally on outside world. We believe in the neutral fiction made up. We

There is no 'me' in me.
Who decides what is moral? Is something that is moral today, will remain moral after let's say a 1000 years? What are morals?

The Fiction machine that controls us. We form ourselves and the society. We form we.
We have found a system of mutual Fiction on which everyone agrees upon and believe so that our society functions properly. Morals are derived from this combined belief about how everything must go. Society is in a process of constant change. Individual beliefs are derived from this system and combined values change itself with the ever evolving society, influencing the individual beliefs and this cycle goes on. This an illusion, but helps us to stay together.
