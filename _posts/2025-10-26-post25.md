Stop your addiction of this digital nonsense. Take care of your body.
Everyday you will meet people who are selfish, mean. These are not bad qualities but the behaviour arising when you think of yourself. Same behaviour in return will not make you greater than those. Try to do your best you can, keeping your interests also.
Learn the art of explaining things. Learn how complex ideas can be explained in simple terms.
Dedicate yourself.
Have a tone of not anger, but of Intelligence.

**Having Scientific temper**
What makes something scientific? Claims that are backed by empirical observations and evidence, and not by beliefs. Something that is falsifiable and is testable. Produce consistent results when tested. That's the beauty. You don't need to have faith in science for it being true. It teaches us the most logical way to approach and understand our surroundings.
