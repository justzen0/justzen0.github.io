We complain a lot about not having the time to do something worth on our skills, try our hobbies. The problem is not the scarcity of time, but the scarcity of management. Time is abundant in the whole day to achieve your daily goals. You just need proper to properly manage your time and efficiently allocate it to tasks.

**Ethical consumption** - Spend only on the things that are truly necessary in your life. No luxury, no status, nothing. Spend money on buying books to increase your knowledge. Reduce your consumption to only that products what you consider necessary.

No one likes me. My image is of a mean and selfish person. They just use me. But I don't care. If I also behave like them then what's the difference? Every day you have to face these people. Develop yourself, be helpful, humble, have the ability to differ right from wrong.

**Attention is limited. Only spend it on your work.**
