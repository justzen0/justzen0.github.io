What I am going to write down now, may sound radical. Some people will find it interesting & some will be repelled by it.     

The point I am going to make is about how to make an egalitarian society. How can we make a society in which people don't consider themselves superior and others inferior. The solution which I talk about is not about bringing a revolution. It is about bringing a subtle change in how we address each other.If we want an egalitarian society, we must start with our family and ensure we value each member equally. Every change that we want in our societies must be first implemented in our own families, because that is the first point of interaction with society where we are clearly able to bring a change. I want Family members to address each others with their actual names rather than their relation in the family hierarchy. No matter how elder or younger someone is, must be called with his/her name. Because when we call someone with the relational word, there arises a sense of superiority and inferiority, a sense of accountability and responsibility. And such a system creates hierarchies, and restricts us unconsciously to being equal. So this simple and little change, are a small effort towards creating an equal society. But it is a very hard thing to implement in our Indian society and culture. But one day, I believe we will do it.
