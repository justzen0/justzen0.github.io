There is bad everywhere out there. But, don't let it demotivate you. Don't let it demoralise you.
Attachments. Attachment to anything is bad. either objects or humans. it's bad. You are going to regret when you will face the truth. Attachments and expectation to someone leads to regret. Know yourself. experience yourself. everything is temporary. Only you will remain till the end of your life.
