Imagine that you are told to live in a room completely white, everything that is present in the room is white, even your clothes, there is no mirror to look into. Everything is just plain white. Would you love to live in such a room for a day, a month, a year, or a lifetime? Would you want to send your children into such a room? Monotony is too boring. This tribalism baggage in the era of cosmopolitanism will destroy us. That is what I want to say. Being an atheist I don't want to abolish religion all together from the world, I just want that the practice of religion becomes more private, become more inclusive and respect each other, I don't want the world to be just monotone. Diversity brings alot to our lives. Everyone should understand that in the grand scheme of things, we are first humans, all of us, and our divisions comes next. We should first try to understand and hold over judgement, Live mindfully and let live.
