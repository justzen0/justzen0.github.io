Look around you.
Observe nature — not through the borrowed eyes of philosophers or priests, but through your own open, innocent eyes.

Everything that exists is vibrant, fulfilled, ecstatic.
Flowers bloom in full glory, peacocks dance, lions roar, the wind stirs the trees into rhythm.
Everything in nature is total. Alive. Present.

But have you ever asked — why?

Why this dance? Why this fragrance? Why such beauty and intensity?
The answer is simple:
Everything is moving towards sex. Towards creation.

And yes, the moment you read the word “sex,” you flinch.
Not because it’s wrong — but because you’ve been conditioned to think it is.
That’s why I ask you to begin not with judgment, but with observation.

See clearly — sex is not something dirty.
It is the ultimate meaning of life.
It is the most sacred act — the act of creation itself.

If God is the Creator, and we are made in His image,then we are not just mechanical beings — we are creators.
But for thousands of years, humanity has condemned this act.
We have made it taboo.
Even uttering the word "sex" makes people turn their heads in discomfort.

This suppression has corrupted the psyche of humanity.
Talking about sex is not disgusting — suppressing it is.
That which is divine has been dragged into the mud, hidden under shame, and used in secret.
And because we haven’t meditated upon this sacred power of creation,
what we have created in the world is mostly distorted:machines of war, systems of control, monuments of ego.

You carry within you a tremendous creative force.
This is not just about the act of copulation — but the raw, vital energy that drives creation itself.

When this energy is unconscious, it becomes lust.
When it is repressed, it becomes perversion.
But when it is understood and transformed, it becomes art, poetry, silence, meditation, bliss.

You have been taught only one outlet for this energy — but that’s not the only way.
Sex can be a doorway.
It can become a ladder — from biology to spirituality.
From reproduction to realization.

To know your true creativity,
you must first reclaim your connection to this sacred force within you.
