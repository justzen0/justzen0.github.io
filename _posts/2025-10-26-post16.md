Loneliness & boredom is an amazing thing. It helps you to think deep about topics. At the end, everyone is alone. We have to learn & how to channel this loneliness into creativity.
NIHILISM – a belief in nothing.
Having an existential crisis is not a bad thing. It's just questioning the nature of reality in which we live.
Does life has a meaning? Life in itself is objectively meaningless.
Why is life? Just because some atoms & molecules aligned up & with the natural processes of chemical & natural selection for millions of years made up sentient/conscious life that has the ability to question its own existence. And now here we are. There is no purpose to all of this. Life is meaningless. Real purpose lies within (what our mind believes makes our purpose).
