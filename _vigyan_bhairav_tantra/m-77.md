### Everything converges in your being

##### What the Method Is

The core instruction, or sutra, as presented in the text is: **"Everything converges in your being"**. This implies a profound state where all perceived divisions, external phenomena, and even the individual self, are experienced as coming together or dissolving into one's innermost core or the universal existence. It signifies a state of ultimate unity and non-duality.

##### How it is done

While the sources do not provide specific step-by-step instructions for _this exact sutra_, the state of "everything converging in your being" is described as the **result of successfully practicing other centering and awareness techniques** in Tantra.

Based on broader Tantric principles discussed by Osho:

- **Centering the Consciousness**: The path to this state involves **centering one's consciousness**. Osho explains that "the center is not significant, centering is significant". When you are truly centered, whether through focusing on the spine, heart, third eye, or even the navel, your consciousness is gathered and can then expand or dissolve into the whole.
- **Dissolving External and Internal Objects**: Techniques that involve concentrating on an external object until it dissolves, or withdrawing attention from external and internal phenomena (like thoughts or sensory inputs), are designed to throw one back to the inner, pure subjectivity where everything converges.
- **Non-Identification and Witnessing**: This involves shifting one's focus from the "clouds" (thoughts, desires, external objects) to the "sky" (the witnessing consciousness) in which they arise. By becoming a **witness** to everything happening, whether it's a mood, a sensation, or an external event, one remains in the middle and avoids being drawn into identification, allowing a deeper, unifying awareness to emerge.
- **Total Acceptance**: Tantra emphasises total acceptance of all energies and experiences, including those often repressed like sex or anger. By accepting these fully without judgment or suppression, the energy is allowed to flow back to its source within oneself, contributing to the convergence.

##### Commentaries and Insights

- **The Ultimate Goal (Samadhi)**: The convergence signifies the ultimate goal of meditation, often referred to as **samadhi** or **cosmic consciousness**. In this state, the individual center disappears, and there is no "ego," because the individual has become "one with the cosmos". This is described as an **"oceanic feeling"** where the "iceberg" (the individual self) melts into the "ocean" (existence).
- **Explosion of Being**: Osho explains that **centering is a means to "explode"**. Once one's energy is gathered and crystallized at a single point, that point "explodes automatically," leading to a state where the "center is everywhere" or "nowhere".
- **Non-Duality (Advait)**: This experience aligns with the Tantric philosophy of **non-duality**, where all perceived distinctions and dualities (like self/other, body/mind, pure/impure, life/death, pain/pleasure) are transcended and seen as integrated within a single reality. It's a realization that "this very world is divine" and that "existence is one".
- **Transformation of Energy**: This convergence is not about discarding parts of oneself, but about transforming all energies. For instance, sex energy, when experienced with total awareness and acceptance, can lead to a feeling of oneness, where the body and mind dissolve and merge, becoming a "meditative circle". This allows energy to be absorbed at higher centers.
- **Beyond Knowledge**: In this state, the conceptual mind and its divisions cease to operate. The experience is beyond words and logic, and cannot be intellectualised. One simply "knows" existentially, without the need for thought or definition. It can be described negatively as "I am no more" (Buddha) or positively as "I am all" (Shankara), both indicating the dissolution of individual boundaries.
- **Simplicity and Potency**: Osho repeatedly states that these seemingly simple methods are profoundly powerful because they touch fundamental realities. The mind often dismisses simplicity, preferring arduous tasks that feed the ego, but spiritual transformation happens with ease when the right technique is applied with awareness.
- **Inner Space as All-Inclusive**: Through centering, particularly in the "third eye" region, one experiences an "inner space" that becomes "all inclusive," leading to the realization that the "whole world is in you, you become the universe".
- **The Unmoving Center**: The practice reveals an innermost core that is "eternally unmoving" amidst the constantly changing periphery of life. Realizing this unmoving center is enough to liberate one.
- **The Role of Imagination**: While starting with imagination, the visualization of convergence (such as light rising in the spine or sensing cosmic waves) can become a reality, especially when attention is deeply focused.
- **Freedom from Dreams and Attachments**: As one moves towards this state of convergence, dreaming and identification with the past or desires diminish, leading to a state of complete presence and completeness.
- **Acceptance as Foundation**: For these techniques to work, a fundamental attitude of **total acceptance** is necessary. This means embracing everything as it is without judgment or resistance, which in turn releases energy to penetrate inwards and facilitate convergence.
