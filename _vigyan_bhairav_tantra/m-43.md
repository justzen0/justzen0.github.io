### Focus your mind on the tongue

##### What the Method Is
The core instruction for this meditation method is: "**With mouth slightly open, keep mind in the middle of the tongue. Or, as breath comes silently in, feel the sound “hh.”**". This technique aims to shift the mind's focus from its usual operation in the head to other bodily centers, specifically the tongue, or to be aware of the subtle sound generated by incoming breath.

##### How It Is Done
This meditation method offers two primary approaches:

*   **Part 1: Focusing on the Tongue**
    *   **Position the Mouth**: Keep your **mouth slightly open**, as if you are "just going to speak" but without actually vocalizing any words.
    *   **Direct Mind to Tongue's Center**: **Shift your entire consciousness and focus to the middle of your tongue**.
    *   **Observe and Cease Thoughts**: By intensely focusing your mind here, the aim is to **stop the continuous flow of thoughts**. Osho explains that thoughts are a form of "talking within," and the tongue is implicitly involved in this inner speech. By bringing total consciousness to the tongue's center, the subtle vibrations associated with inner talking cease, thereby halting thought. If the tongue is held completely still or "frozen," thinking becomes impossible.

*   **Part 2: Feeling the "hh" Sound of Incoming Breath (Alternative or Complementary)**
    *   **Maintain Mouth Position**: Again, keep the mouth slightly open.
    *   **Silent Inhalation**: **Inhale silently**.
    *   **Feel the Subtle Sound**: **Become aware of the natural, very subtle "hh" sound** that is created by the incoming breath as it passes over your tongue. This sound is quiet and requires keen alertness to perceive.
    *   **Crucial Distinction**: It is vital **not to consciously *make* this "hh" sound**, but rather to ***feel* the natural sound** that is already present with the inhalation.
    *   **Deepening Awareness**: As you continue this practice, you may begin to feel the "hh" sound not just at the tongue, but also deeper within, in the throat, and eventually even in the heart.

*   **General Practice Guidance**:
    *   This technique is described as a **"sudden method"** that helps break old mental patterns, suggesting that rather than prolonged, continuous practice, sudden, focused application can be highly effective.
    *   It is particularly **suitable for individuals with a sensitive ear** or those who work with sound, such as musicians or poets, as its delicate nature may make it challenging for others. Becoming proficient in this technique may take several months, for example, "three or four months" to become an "expert".

##### Commentaries and Insights
*   **Mind's Location and Quality**: Tantra posits that the **mind's focus can be shifted to various centers in the body**, not just confined to the head. Each center, when concentrated upon, can alter the qualities of the mind. For instance, focusing the mind two inches below the navel (hara), as practiced by Japanese samurai, develops distinct qualities that contribute to their prowess.
*   **Tongue as a Thought Control Center**: The essence of thought is likened to "talking within". The tongue, possessing a specific control center, is directly involved in this internal verbalization. By **concentrating consciousness on the middle of the tongue**, one can directly interrupt and cease the mental chatter, leading to a state of inner silence.
*   **From Thought to Inner Solidity**: When thoughts cease through this method, the practitioner may experience a profound shift, feeling an **inner "solidity" and "immovability"**. This indicates a connection to the eternal, unmoving essence of being, transcending the constant movement of the mind.
*   **Breath as an Inner Bridge**: Emphasizing the **incoming breath** in the "hh" sound variation helps direct awareness inward. This practice serves as a **"bridge"** to move from the realm of thought to "no-thought," from the superficial "mind" to the deeper "no-mind," effectively transitioning from the periphery of consciousness to its inner core.
*   **Sound as a Transitional Tool**: Osho explains that sound is fundamental to human thought, with words and philosophies built upon it. This technique employs sound (or its subtle perception) as a "jumping board" to transcend the mind. It's a method to use the mind's own structure to go beyond it, much like Yoga and Tantra suggest using what is already present to reach what is hidden.
*   **Tantra's Practical and Accepting Nature**: Tantra is a **scientific approach focused on "how" to attain truth experientially**, rather than philosophical "why" questions. It is **amoral**, not imposing external moral judgments but rather accepting all energies, including those typically condemned (like sexual energy), as potential vehicles for transformation when approached with awareness. This method embodies Tantra's principle of working with existing bodily and mental processes to achieve deeper states.
*   **Simplicity Concealing Depth**: While the technique's instructions might appear simple, its practical application requires significant effort and sustained awareness. The mind, driven by ego, often seeks complex challenges, dismissing simple methods. However, Tantra's simple techniques are potent because they directly address fundamental aspects of existence, leading to profound internal shifts.
*   **Beyond Mental Activity**: The ultimate purpose of such techniques is to **"put the mind aside"**. When the mind is no longer active, the true self emerges. The goal is to integrate **consciousness with thoughtlessness**, giving rise to authentic meditation.
*   **Cultivating Sensitivity**: The ability to perceive subtle sensations and sounds, such as the faint "hh" of breath or the delicate nuances of music, is crucial for inner work. Tantra and Zen traditions emphasize training one's senses to achieve this heightened sensitivity, which helps move beyond mere intellectual understanding into direct experience.
*   **Experiential Transformation**: The transformation achieved through these techniques is not intellectual but **experiential**. It involves a shift in one's being, where the inner journey unfolds through direct experience rather than conceptual knowledge. The process leads to a state where the practitioner is "unburdened," "clean," "simple," and "innocent".
