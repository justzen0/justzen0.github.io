### Beyond knowing and not-knowing

##### What the method is

The phrase "Beyond knowing and not-knowing" signifies a state that transcends intellectual understanding and dualistic perception, which are inherent to the mind. While not a specific sutra itself, it represents the ultimate aim of many Tantric meditations: to move beyond the limitations of the mind and its concepts, including the very act of knowing or not-knowing something, to experience pure being or emptiness (_shunya_). It is about arriving at a state of **no-mind**, where consciousness is present without the constant analytical and dualistic functioning of the intellect.

##### How it is done

Achieving the state of "Beyond knowing and not-knowing" is not a direct instruction but an outcome of various Tantric techniques that lead to the **dissolution of the mind** and its dualities. While no singular "how-to" for this exact phrase exists in the sources, the path involves:

- **Practicing any Tantric meditation technique diligently**: Tantra is concerned with "how" to attain truth, emphasizing method and technique over philosophy. The 112 methods are designed to help cleanse and transcend the mind. The mind, being a process, can be used as a "jumping board" to go beyond itself.
- **Embracing an existential and non-intellectual approach**: Tantra is an experience, not an intellectual proposition. One must _do_ the techniques, not just think about them.
- **Transcending dualities and seeking the middle path**: The mind operates by dividing reality into opposites (e.g., good/bad, pure/impure, pleasure/pain, life/death, knowing/not-knowing). The aim is to **remain in the middle**, avoiding extremes and ultimately moving to a state of choicelessness. Techniques that involve remaining undisturbed amidst desire, accepting inner states, or simply "being" without doing contribute to this.
- **Developing perfect awareness/alertness**: The core of all Tantric techniques is to foster uninterrupted awareness, which naturally leads to the mind's cessation. When awareness becomes perfect, the "no-desire" state happens.
- **Accepting oneself and reality totally**: Tantra emphasizes total acceptance of everything as it is, without judgment or condemnation, which helps to dissolve inner conflicts and allows for transformation. This includes accepting one's "animal heritage" and not being negative about one's instincts.

##### Commentaries and Insights

- **Mind as the Disease**: Tantra views the mind itself as the disease, not merely something that can be ill. Therefore, the goal is not to have a healthy mind, but to go _beyond_ the mind. The mind is seen as a process, a constant "minding" rather than a fixed "thing".
- **Beyond Duality (Bhairava/Bhairavi State)**: The term _Vigyan Bhairav Tantra_ itself signifies "the method of going beyond consciousness". _Bhairava_ and _Bhairavi_ represent those who have transcended dualities, including the conscious and unconscious. This implies that a state exists where the categories of "knowing" and "not-knowing" become meaningless, as one simply _is_.
- **Emptiness (Shunya)**: When the layers of body and mind are peeled away, one encounters a **nothingness, an abyss, a bottomless void**, which Buddha called _shunya_. This state is "beyond knowing and not-knowing" because there is no object to be known, only the pure consciousness of being.
- **The Problem of Intellect**: The mind, being intellectual and argumentative, often resists simple techniques because it seeks difficulty to satisfy the ego. It can turn anything into a problem, including the idea of "non-seeking" or "no-mind". The state beyond knowing and not-knowing cannot be grasped by the intellect.
- **Transformation vs. Adjustment**: Meditation, according to Tantra, is a science that aims for **transformation of being**, not mere adjustment to societal norms or mental peace. This transformation involves breaking false identifications and cultivating presence.
- **The Role of Doubt and Faith**: For intellectual types, the path proceeds through doubt, leading to experimental techniques where faith is a _consequence_ of experience, not a prerequisite. The aim is to resolve the doubting mind itself, rather than seeking intellectual answers.
- **Beyond Words and Sounds**: The mind is an accumulation of words and thoughts. Techniques involve moving from philosophical concepts to thoughts, then to words, letters, and finally to sounds and subtle feelings, before leaving even feelings aside to experience pure being.
- **Beyond Happiness and Misery**: An enlightened person is beyond both bliss and misery, having ceased to "cause" anything. This indicates a state beyond the mind's evaluations and preferences.
- **Gradual vs. Sudden Enlightenment**: While enlightenment itself is a sudden explosion, the preparation to bear it involves gradual methods that clarify the mind and remove barriers. The clarity gained is of a "lessening disease," not true spiritual health until the mind itself disappears.
- **The Essence of Reality**: Reality is simple and unproblematic, becoming complex only through the lens of the mind. The ultimate truth is **already here and now**, not something to be attained in the future. The techniques remove the mental barriers that prevent the experience of this already-present reality.
