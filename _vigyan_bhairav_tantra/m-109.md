### Include everything in your being

##### What the method is
The specific core instruction or sutra for the meditation method "Include everything in your being" **is not explicitly provided within the given excerpts**. It is listed as one of the "Techniques to Become One with the Whole".

##### How it is done
**Specific, step-by-step practical guidance for practicing "Include everything in your being" is not detailed in the provided texts**. However, drawing from Osho's general advice on Tantric meditation techniques, the practice would likely involve:
*   **Playfulness and Sincerity**: Initially, one is encouraged to "just play" with techniques to see if they "click" or resonate, bringing a "feeling of affinity" or "well-being". If a method resonates, it should then be pursued with seriousness and intensity.
*   **Total Awareness and Immersion**: The practitioner should aim for "keen, sincere observation and attention", remaining fully present "with no word, with no verbalization, with no bubbling inside â€“ just remaining with" the sensation or phenomenon.
*   **Non-Intellectual Approach**: Tantric methods are experiential, not intellectual. They are concerned with "how" truth can be attained through direct experience rather than philosophical inquiry.
*   **Effortless Effort**: While an initial "effort" might be required to engage with the technique, the ultimate goal is to achieve an "effortless effort", allowing the experience to unfold spontaneously rather than being forced by the mind.

##### Commentaries and Insights
While direct commentaries on "Include everything in your being" are not present, its title strongly reflects **core Tantric principles** discussed extensively by Osho in *The Book of Secrets*:
*   **Transcending Duality and Achieving Oneness**: A fundamental tenet of Tantra is the **rejection of duality**. The world (sansara) and liberation (moksha) are not seen as opposing forces but as two dimensions of one existence. The ultimate goal is to realize that "existence and you mean one and the same thing". This method likely aims at dissolving the perceived boundaries between oneself and the external world, leading to an **"oceanic feeling" of becoming one with the cosmos**.
*   **Total Acceptance**: Tantra emphasizes **total acceptance of oneself and all aspects of existence**. This means embracing all energies and experiences, including those traditionally seen as negative like anger or sex, rather than suppressing them. Acceptance is seen as the pathway to **transcendence**. If one can accept everything, the inner division dissolves, leading to wholeness.
*   **Dissolution of the Ego ("No-Self")**: The practice aims for the **dissolution of the individual center or ego**, leading to a state where there is no longer an "I" or "self" that feels separate. This can manifest as feeling "no more" or "all". If you are "all," then "you are not".
*   **Mind as the Barrier and Door**: The mind is seen as creating divisions and problems. However, it can also be used as a "door" or "jumping board" to go beyond itself. The mind is seen as containing everything, and by being aware of its wandering, one can access the "buddha-mind".
*   **Spiritual Health as a Result**: When the mind is "no more," a state of clarity, silence, and spiritual health emerges. This is not an adjustment but a fundamental **transformation**.
*   **Omnipresence**: Through such practices, the individual can become **omnipresent**, moving from being a finite point (ego) to being everywhere, like the infinite ocean.
*   **Simplicity and Depth**: Osho consistently highlights that while Tantric techniques appear simple, their execution can be profound and lead to "miraculous" experiences. The true challenge lies in the practitioner's alertness and sincerity, not the complexity of the method itself.
*   **Warnings (General Tantra)**: While not specific to this method, Osho gives general warnings that powerful Tantric methods, especially those dealing directly with energy (like Kundalini), **can be dangerous if not completed properly or if one tries to force things**. Guidance from a master can be beneficial for powerful techniques or if discomfort arises.
