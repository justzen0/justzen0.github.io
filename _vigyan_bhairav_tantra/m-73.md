### Become the clarity of the cloudless sky

##### What the Method Is

The core instruction for this method is: "**Shakti, see all space as if already absorbed in your own head in the brilliance.**" This is further illuminated by the related instruction, "**In summer when you see the entire sky endlessly clear enter such clarity.**" and "**Waking, sleeping, dreaming, know you as light.**". These sutras invite the practitioner to perceive their inner being as boundless, radiant clarity, akin to a cloudless sky, across all states of consciousness.

##### How It Is Done

To practise this method, you should:

*   **Mind as Sky, Thoughts as Clouds**: Understand that your mind is like an endless sky, and thoughts, desires, and passions are merely clouds passing through it. The sky itself remains pure and untouched by the clouds.
*   **Shift Focus**: Instead of focusing on the 'clouds' (thoughts and desires) or attempting to stop them, **shift your attention to the 'sky' itself** – the space in which these thoughts move.
*   **Allow Wandering**: Do not try to stop the mind from wandering. Let the thoughts wander, but direct your awareness to the *background* of that wandering, to the pure, vacant inner space.
*   **Self-Identification with Sky**: **Actively feel yourself as the sky, not the clouds**. This involves a non-thinking, non-verbal feeling of 'you-areness' or being, rather than identifying with characteristics or concepts.
*   **Conscious Doing**: Apply this awareness to all daily activities. Whether eating, sleeping, walking, or working, remain attentive to this inner sky. For example, while drawing water, simply draw water without allowing the mind to wander into other thoughts or problems. This is about being "merged with the moment with no future, no past".
*   **Continuous Practice**: This practice needs to be **continuous**. Initially, you might set aside specific periods for practice. However, the aim is for this awareness to penetrate all aspects of your life, including sleep and dreams.
*   **Non-Interference**: Do not try to force or cultivate stillness. Simply be alert and allow the phenomena to unfold, understanding that forcing creates tension and prevents true insight.

##### Commentaries and Insights

*   **The Mind's True Nature**: Osho explains that the mind, in its original state, is like a mirror – pure and clear, though dust (thoughts, experiences, memories) can gather on it. The goal is to regain this original purity, which is always present, but often obscured by identification with the past and thoughts.
*   **Beyond Duality and Ego**: Perceiving the mind as a boundless, clear sky helps dissolve the ego, which thrives on boundaries and definitions. When the ego (the 'wave') is no longer clung to, one naturally falls into the 'ocean' of cosmic existence. This aligns with Tantra's emphasis on non-duality and total acceptance.
*   **Transformation into Buddha-Mind**: When the mind is unclouded, the individual is a Buddha. This practice makes one a **master** of their inner world; the world no longer dominates, but can be moved within, revealing its inherent beauty. This is the essence of becoming a 'buddha,' an awakened one, where one is fully present and conscious.
*   **Physiological and Inner Change**: This method is not merely intellectual. As one shifts perception to the internal 'sky', the 'clouds' (thoughts) become less dense, their speed slows down, and the gaps between them become larger. Ultimately, thought can disappear, leading to a state of **no-mind**.
*   **Simplicity and Depth**: Osho repeatedly stresses that these Tantric methods, despite their seeming simplicity, are profoundly powerful because they directly touch fundamental realities of existence. The mind often resists simple solutions because the ego is drawn to arduous tasks that promise a sense of accomplishment.
*   **Tantra as Science of Transformation**: Tantra is presented as a science of "how" to attain truth through experience, rather than a philosophy concerned with "why". It provides techniques to transform one's being by shifting consciousness and perception. It is not about forcing control, but understanding, which leads to spontaneous transformation.
*   **Connection to Zen**: This technique has deep roots in Zen tradition, exemplified by practices like "Zazen" (just sitting, doing nothing) and concepts like the "ordinary mind is the buddha-mind". Zen masters might instruct disciples to simply "eat when hungry, sleep when sleepy," implying complete presence in the moment.
*   **Role of Awareness**: The entire process hinges on increasing **alertness** and **awareness**. With greater awareness, the internal 'dreaming' or 'sleep' state diminishes, bringing one to the real.
*   **Glimpse of the Real**: Even a momentary, non-verbal feeling of 'you-areness' or being provides a glimpse of the real, which is beyond what any drug can offer. This glimpse, though momentary, gives a taste of buddhahood.
*   **Master's Guidance**: While these techniques can be explored independently, Osho notes that personal **initiation** from a master can significantly accelerate and deepen the process by tailoring the method to the individual's specific needs and guiding them through potential challenges.
*   **Total Acceptance**: The practice aligns with Tantra's fundamental principle of **total acceptance** of oneself and existence as it is, without judgment or condemnation. This acceptance frees up energy that can then be directed inward for transformation.
