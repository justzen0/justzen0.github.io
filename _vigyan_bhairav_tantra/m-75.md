### Remember yourself as light

##### What the Method Is

The core instruction or sutra for this method is: "**Waking, sleeping, dreaming, know you as light.**". This brief statement encapsulates the essence of the practice, which is to cultivate an unbroken awareness of one's fundamental nature as light, regardless of the state of consciousness one is in. This technique is presented within the chapter on "Conscious Doing," highlighting the importance of presence and awareness in all activities.

##### How It Is Done

The practice of "Remember yourself as light" is not a set of rigid physical steps, but rather a continuous internal cultivation of awareness:

*   **Maintain Awareness in All States**: The primary instruction is to **know yourself as light** whether you are **waking, sleeping, or dreaming**. This means extending your self-awareness into all aspects of your daily and nightly existence.
*   **Conscious Self-Remembering**: This method fundamentally relies on **self-remembering**. It involves being continuously aware of your own being, rather than being solely focused on external objects or internal thoughts.
*   **Feel, Don't Think**: The emphasis is on **feeling** oneself as light, rather than merely intellectualizing or verbalizing it. One should cultivate a **non-verbal sense of one's existence** or "am-ness". This means not repeating words like "I am" mentally, but directly feeling the presence of your being.
*   **Integration into Daily Life**: This practice is designed to be integrated into all daily activities. Whether you are eating, bathing, walking, or sitting, you can suddenly "remember yourself" and try to continue that glimpse of your being. The goal is to bring **total presence** to every act.
*   **Effortless Effort**: While it appears simple, the practice requires **persistent effort**. However, this effort should transition into an "effortless effort" (as in Zen), where one is "doing as if not doing". The mind often resists simple things, making them seem difficult, but the key is to not be too serious and instead "play" with the method.

##### Commentaries and Insights

*   **The Nature of Existence as Light/Energy**: Osho explains that the visualization of oneself as light is not just imagination; it is rooted in the fundamental reality that **all existence, including human beings, is composed of light particles or energy**. This aligns with modern scientific understanding that everything consists of electricity, and ancient spiritual texts like the Koran that refer to God as light.
*   **From Absence to Presence**: A core insight is that human suffering stems from living in a state of "absence" or unawareness of one's own presence. This technique aims to fill the practitioner with their "own presence" and the "light of their own being," which is considered the essence of being religious. When one acts with total presence, life becomes ecstatic; without it, life becomes suffering.
*   **Unblocking the Third Eye and Inner Awareness**: Although not directly stating the third eye for this specific method, related techniques involving light and inner space often connect to the **third eye (pineal gland)**, which when activated, allows one to experience thoughts as separate and perceive inner, boundless space. The intensity of awareness cultivated through this method helps one become more alert to the real, breaking free from mental constructs and dreams.
*   **Transformation of States of Consciousness**:
    *   **Waking**: By remembering oneself as light, a new **lightness** comes, and the "heaviness" of the false self disappears. It helps in moving from a state of being "off-center" (eccentric) to being **regrounded in one's own center**.
    *   **Dreaming**: If the continuous self-remembering is maintained throughout the day, it penetrates sleep and allows one to remain aware even while dreaming. When you know you are dreaming within the dream, the dream loses its power to deceive and ceases to feel like reality. An enlightened person does not dream because their consciousness remains even in sleep, and their experiences are complete, eliminating the psychological need for dreams to resolve incompleteness.
    *   **Sleeping**: An enlightened person's sleep is distinct; only the body sleeps, while consciousness remains fully alert. This deep, aware sleep brings profound rest without unconsciousness.
*   **Transcending the Mind and Ego**: This technique provides a glimpse of what is beyond the mind. By focusing on one's simple existence, labels (name, country, religion) are transcended, leading to a shift from the **false ego-centered identity** to the **real, authentic center**. When the ego is transcended, one either becomes "no more" (nothingness) or "all" (the cosmos), both meaning the same non-dual state.
*   **Simplicity and Depth**: Osho consistently highlights that Tantric techniques, despite their apparent simplicity, are profoundly impactful because they address fundamental realities directly. The mind often overcomplicates things, preferring "difficult" methods that inflate the ego. The true spiritual explosion is not a causal phenomenon requiring time, but an immediate realization of what already is.
*   **Master's Role and Authenticity**: While anyone can try these methods, Osho indicates that initiation by a master can make the process qualitatively different, as it involves a personalized approach and secret transmission of energy. However, the ultimate authority is one's own experience, not external validation or scriptures. Authenticity is crucial; imitation is considered "phony" and hinders real transformation.
*   **No Fixed Outcome**: The outcome of this deep self-discovery is unique to each individual; it is unpredictable, fostering freedom rather than conforming to a predetermined ideal. This means you discover your own "buddhahood" rather than imitating another.
