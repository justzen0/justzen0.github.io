### Look into unlimited space

##### What the method is

This meditation method, closely related to the practice of "Simply by looking into the blue sky beyond clouds, the serenity," involves **directing one's gaze into boundless void** to induce a state of inner peace and awareness. The core instruction for the similar technique is: "Simply by looking into the blue sky beyond clouds, the serenity".

##### How it is done

To practice this method, you should:

- **Look into the blue sky beyond clouds**: The technique involves gazing into the expansive, clear blue sky, going past any clouds, which are considered objects.
- **Maintain a non-thinking, innocent look**: It is crucial not to engage in thoughts while looking. This means not thinking about the sky's beauty, its color, or verbalizing anything about it. The goal is a "pure, innocent look" without any mental chatter.
- **Avoid words and verbalization**: Words become barriers, preventing the eyes from truly moving into the infinite blue. Do not even mentally name it "blue sky".

##### Commentaries and Insights

- **Purpose and Outcome**: The aim of this practice is to achieve **serenity** and **inner silence**. By looking into the infinite sky, the mind, which is accustomed to processing objects, stops functioning because there is no object to focus on. This cessation of mental activity leads to a feeling of peace and fulfillment. When the mind disappears, serenity results.
- **Nature of the Sky**: The sky is selected as the object of contemplation because it is **infinite** and has no boundaries; it is not an object that begins and ends. It is pure emptiness, a vacuum in which all other objects exist. You are meant to look _into_ it, not _at_ it, signifying a boundless experience.
- **Dissolution of Desire**: When one looks into emptiness, no desires arise, as there is nothing to possess or engage with. Desire is seen as the "seed of madness" and a source of disturbance. The non-arising of desire brings **serenity** and allows you to "become like the sky" yourself.
- **Transformation through Contemplation**: Osho explains that "whatsoever you contemplate, you become like it". By deeply observing the empty, blue sky, you will begin to experience the same vastness, blueness, and emptiness within yourself.
- **Simplicity vs. Ego**: The technique is profoundly simple and does not require going to a special place or spending money, as the sky is always available. However, its very simplicity can be a hindrance, as the ego tends to be attracted only to difficult challenges that offer a sense of conquest and fulfillment. Simple methods often lack appeal to the ego, yet "that which appeals to the ego cannot help your spiritual growth".
- **Readiness for Sudden Enlightenment**: These simple techniques are not designed to _gradually bring_ enlightenment, but rather to _gradually prepare_ the practitioner for a **sudden spiritual happening or explosion** (samadhi). Enlightenment is akin to death: it is sudden, not a gradual process. The techniques foster **alertness**, bringing you out of your "dreaming state" and back to your true, ever-present nature. An alert state of mind is nirvana, while a non-alert state is the world.
- **Warnings**: It is crucial to **resist imagination** during this practice. Do not try to imagine the light or the opening of the third eye, as this will only result in a "beautiful, spiritual dream" rather than a genuine experience. The practice requires patience and waiting for the natural unfolding of the experience. Postponing practice, often a trick of the mind, will hinder this sudden shift.
