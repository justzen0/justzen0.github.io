### Watch the fusion point between two breaths

##### What the Method Is
The core instruction for this meditation technique, as presented by Shiva, is: "**Or, whenever in-breath and out-breath fuse, at this instant touch the energy-less, energy-filled center.**" This means focusing one's awareness on the precise moment when the incoming and outgoing breaths become one, a subtle point of transition.

##### How It Is Done
To practice this method, you should:
*   **Observe the Breath's Transition**: Direct your attention to the **exact moment** when the outgoing breath merges with the incoming breath, or when the incoming breath has fully entered and begins its outward journey. This is a brief instant when the breath is **static, silent, and non-moving**—neither going in nor going out.
*   **Locate the Center**: Recognize that the breath travels to and from your **innermost center**, which Tantra identifies as the **navel (hara)**.
*   **Practice Deep, Slow Breathing**: Consciously cultivate **deep, slow breaths** that reach down to the abdomen, allowing the breath to touch this navel center, rather than relying on shallow chest breathing.
*   **Maintain Minute Observation**: This fusion point is of very short duration and demands **minute observation** and keen attention. It requires overcoming the mind's natural tendency to jump from one thought to another.
*   **Remain Without Verbalization**: True observation means "remaining with no word, with no verbalization, with no bubbling inside – just remaining with" the experience of the breath's fusion.

##### Commentaries and Insights
*   **Subtle Nature of the Fusion Point**: This technique emphasizes the very subtle, static moment of breath, contrasting it with the dynamic movement of inhalation and exhalation. It is a specific approach that highlights the **fusion** or "becoming one" of the breaths.
*   **The Navel as the True Center**: Osho explains that while the head is often perceived as the human center, the **navel (hara)** is the true, original, and deeply rooted center of being. The breath is intrinsically linked to this center, constantly moving to and from it. The feeling of being "off-center" in the modern world is attributed to a lack of deep breathing that connects to this navel point.
*   **"Energy-less, Energy-filled" Paradox**: The center is described as "**energy-less**" because it does not derive energy from the body's "fuel" (like food and drink); however, it is simultaneously "**energy-filled**" because it is connected to the **cosmic source of energy**, transcending the limited physical and mental energies.
*   **Connection to Shallow Breathing and Sexuality**: Osho links modern society's fear and suppression of sexuality to **shallow breathing**, which prevents the breath from reaching the deep abdominal (navel/sex) center. Deep breathing, by stimulating the sex center, is seen as a way to integrate the two flows of life energy: sex (from below upwards) and breath (from above downwards).
*   **Realization of the Self and Enlightenment**: Becoming aware of this fusion point at the center is a direct path to **enlightenment**. When the breath becomes silent and non-moving at this point, the practitioner is profoundly connected to their true self. This technique aims to **uncover the already existing navel center**, rather than developing it, as Buddhahood is considered an inherent state waiting to be realized.
*   **Overcoming Mental Barriers**: The mind often dismisses such seemingly simple techniques because it seeks arduous challenges to satisfy the ego. However, this simplicity is precisely its power, as the truth is already within, and the method merely helps **remove the mental barriers** that obscure it.
*   **Patience and Sensitivity**: Developing the necessary sensitivity to perceive these subtle points requires **patience and sustained effort**. It's advised to start with short, focused periods of practice and gradually integrate this awareness into daily life, while being mindful of the mind's tendency to create excuses or premature conclusions.
*   **Not Yoga**: Osho distinguishes Tantra's use of breath from that of Yoga. While Yoga systematizes breathing for health and longevity, Tantra's sole purpose is to use natural breathing as a **technique to turn inward**, without requiring specific breathing rhythms or styles. The emphasis is purely on awareness of these subtle internal points.
*   **Path to the Present Moment**: All breath-related techniques in Tantra are designed to bring the mind into the **present moment**. When the mind is fully immersed in the present, it naturally ceases, leading to a state of "no-mind," which is the gateway to true freedom and nirvana.
*   **Centering as a Means**: Centering is understood as the **method or path to samadhi**, not the ultimate goal itself. Once one is perfectly centered and crystallized, an "explosion" occurs, causing the individual center to dissolve into the cosmos, leading to an oceanic, all-pervading experience.
