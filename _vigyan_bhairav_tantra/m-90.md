### Fill endless space with your bliss body

##### What the method is

This meditation technique, listed among Shiva's 112 methods, directly instructs the practitioner to **experience their being as a form of boundless, blissful energy that permeates unlimited space**. The core instruction is: "Fill endless space with your bliss body".

##### How it is done

To practice this method, you should:

- **Conceive yourself as light**: Begin by **imagining or conceptualizing your entire being as composed of light rays**. This is not mere imagination, as Tantra suggests that everything, including yourself, fundamentally consists of light particles or energy.
- **Visualize expansion**: Allow this light or blissful essence to **expand outwards from within you**, permeating and filling limitless space. While one related technique involves seeing all space absorbed _in_ your head as brilliance, this method implies the expansion of _your_ bliss body _into_ space.
- **Dissolve the sense of limited form**: The practice aims to transcend the perception of oneself as a confined physical body. This is akin to becoming "weightless" and moving beyond the body and mind, reaching a state of "pure consciousness" or "emptiness" that can then "fill" the universe.
- **Embrace the feeling of omnipresence**: As your being expands, allow yourself to feel "omnipresent" – no longer confined to a single point (the ego), but "everywhere," becoming "the all," like the "ocean" rather than a mere "wave".

##### Commentaries and Insights

- **Purpose and Outcome**: The ultimate aim of this method is to realize **self-actualization** – reaching the highest peak of human potentiality and possibility. By expanding into endless space, the practitioner achieves a state of **profound bliss, peace, and serenity**. This process leads to an **inner rebirth and liberation**, signifying a complete transformation of one's being. It dissolves the identification with the limited ego, leading to a state of being "no more" as an individual, but "one with the cosmos".
- **The Nature of "Bliss Body"**: The "bliss body" is not a physical entity but a state of being that transcends the physical and mental. It is rooted in the Tantric understanding that everything, including human essence, is fundamentally composed of light and energy. This method helps one connect to the "cosmic source" of energy, making the practitioner "energy-filled" rather than reliant on mere "fuel energy" from the body.
- **Beyond Duality and Desire**: When one's being expands to fill endless space, there is no "object" for the mind to cling to, leading to the **dissolution of desire**. Desire is seen as a source of tension and "madness," and its non-arising brings profound serenity and silence. This method aligns with Tantra's philosophy of **total acceptance** and affirmation, rather than fighting against inherent nature or desires.
- **The Role of Imagination and Reality**: Osho emphasizes that while the process begins with imagination, it is rooted in reality, as all existence is essentially light. When the practitioner's attention is focused at the third eye, imagination becomes incredibly potent and can manifest phenomena. However, it is crucial to **resist mere imagination** and allow the experience to unfold naturally, avoiding the creation of a "beautiful, spiritual dream" rather than a genuine transformation.
- **Suddenness vs. Gradual Preparation**: These "simple" techniques are not meant to bring gradual enlightenment, but rather to **prepare the practitioner for a sudden spiritual explosion (samadhi)**. The journey is not about going somewhere else, but about a "discovery" of what is already present.
- **Challenges and Guidance**: Despite its apparent simplicity, the execution of this method is profound. The ego often resists simple methods because it seeks difficulty and conquest. It requires patience, presence, and a willingness to transcend the ordinary analytical mind. For such powerful techniques, guidance from a master can be beneficial, as they can assess the individual's type and provide specific, personalized methods. It's vital to complete the practice once started, as leaving the energy "in the middle" can be harmful.
