### Close the Eyes and Stop Their Movement

##### What the Method Is
The core instruction for this meditation method is given by the sutra: "**Eyes closed, see your inner being in detail. Thus see your true nature**". This method aims to transcend the ordinary perception and reach one's authentic self by directing inner vision.

##### How It Is Done
To practice this meditation, the practitioner should undertake the following steps:
*   **Close Your Eyes**: Begin by simply closing your eyes.
*   **Achieve Total Closing**: The mere act of closing eyes is insufficient; **total closing** implies stopping all inner movements of the eyes. This means no external objects are seen, nor any internal images, ideas, or collected memories, resulting in a blank darkness. It's about being "blind only to reality, but to the dream reality also".
*   **Stop Eye Movements**: Inwardly **stop all movements of the eyes**. The eyes should feel as if they have "become stones," remaining in a "stony" and static state.
*   **Relaxation, Not Force**: It is crucial not to force the eyes to stop or become tense in the process. The face and eyes should be relaxed; one should "let them be closed" rather than closing them forcibly, as forcing creates tension and uneasiness.
*   **Utilize Darkness**: To aid in stopping eye movements, imagine being surrounded by **deep, velvety darkness**. Feeling immersed in this darkness, where "everything is dead – dark and dead," helps the eyes become still.
*   **Inward Observation**: Once the eyes are static, the practitioner becomes capable of **looking inside**. The initial focus is to "look at your body inwardly – from your inner center". After gaining separation from the body, the consciousness can move deeper into the mind, exploring its "nine layers which are within and unconscious". The goal is to "see your inner being in detail – body and mind both".
*   **Practice Consistently**: This technique cannot be achieved suddenly; it requires a "long period" and consistent practice. The initial glimpse is difficult, but once experienced, it becomes easier to enter this inner realm at will.
*   **Resist Imagination**: While practicing, it is vital to **resist imagination** of lights or phenomena. One should simply wait and cooperate with "whatsoever comes," without jumping ahead or creating spiritual dreams.

##### Commentaries and Insights
*   **Eyes as a Unique Gateway**: Osho explains that the eyes are the "most non-bodily part" of the human body, serving as a deep **meeting point between oneself and the body**. They offer the closest and quickest path, a "single jump," to enter one's inner being or source, unlike other body parts where the distance is greater. Consciousness itself can be glimpsed through the eyes.
*   **Interconnectedness of Eyes and Mind**: A fundamental insight is the **direct link between eye movements and the thought process**. If thinking is active, the eyes will move; conversely, if the eyes stop moving, the thought process will immediately cease. This implies that by intentionally stopping eye movements, one can directly stop the mind's incessant activity. This is because the eyes' natural inclination is to move outwards, but when this outward movement is blocked, they are compelled to move inwards.
*   **The Witnessing State and Self-Realization**: This technique is a powerful method for **finding the witness**. When attention is focused and thoughts cease due to the stillness of the eyes, one becomes an observer or spectator of their thoughts, rather than being identified with them. This realization of being the witness, separate from the body and mind, is described as an "ecstatic moment," leading to the knowledge that one is not the body and cannot die.
*   **Opening the Third Eye**: The cessation of outward energy flow through the ordinary eyes causes the energy to seek a new path, the nearest being the **third eye** (pineal gland), located between the eyebrows. This activation of the third eye, which is part of the subtle body, enables the perception of a "subtle world" and a "light without source," leading to a profound transformation.
*   **Tantra's View on Body and Transformation**: Tantra deeply emphasizes the body, seeing it as a **vehicle to move to the spirit**. It holds that condemnation of the body is "foolish, absolutely idiotic" and that one must use its energies to go beyond. This method utilizes a physiological control (stopping eye movements) to influence psychological and spiritual states, reflecting Tantra's scientific approach to inner transformation.
*   **Purity and Awakening**: For Tantra, **alertness is purity**, and sleep is impurity. This technique is designed to cultivate greater alertness, breaking the pattern of being "asleep" even while awake, thereby leading to "awakening" or enlightenment. The "suddenness" of such an awakening is often preceded by gradual preparation through techniques like this.
*   **Beyond Mind, Beyond Duality**: The ultimate aim of meditation is to move beyond the mind, which is seen as a "spiritual disease". By stopping eye movements, one can achieve a state of "thoughtless consciousness". This transcends the dualities of conscious and unconscious, leading to a state of pure being where one is simply "present" and "here and now". This experience is difficult to articulate, as language is often insufficient to describe the "infinite experience" of samadhi.
*   **Historical and Traditional Connections**: This method is part of the 112 meditation techniques from the Vigyan Bhairav Tantra, an ancient text considered the "source book of all techniques". Osho connects it to the practices of masters like **Buddha**, who, at the moment of his death, demonstrated the ability to make his eyes static before moving inward. It relates to Zen concepts of stillness and awareness, although Osho clarifies that while Zen emphasizes spontaneity, for most, techniques are necessary to reach that state.
