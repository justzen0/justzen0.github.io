### See the world as a drama

##### What the Method Is

The core instruction, or sutra, for this method is: **"This so-called universe appears as a juggling, a picture show. To be happy, look upon it so."** This calls for seeing life as a non-serious, theatrical performance.

##### How It Is Done

To practice "See the world as a drama," the guidance involves:

*   **Cultivate a Non-Serious Attitude**: The fundamental step is to **stop taking life too seriously**. Seriousness is identified as a primary cause of trouble and unhappiness.
*   **Conscious Re-enactment**: Actively **behave as if the whole world is just a dream or a drama**. For example, interact with family members as if you are playing a part in a play.
*   **Maintain Detachment**: When enacting your role, aim to be **efficient but not disturbed**. The goal is for your life to feel "as if it is not happening to you, as if it is happening to someone else".
*   **Focus on the "Gap" (Inner Centering)**: Crucially, while activities continue on the periphery, **remain constantly centered in your inner being**, specifically by attending to the "gap" between breaths (as discussed in other techniques). If this inner centering is lost, identification with the role occurs.
*   **Embrace Predetermination (as a device)**: Consider that everything in life is **fixed or predetermined**, like a script. This perspective helps one become an observer, merely enacting a role rather than being the source of actions, thereby fostering detachment and reducing the burden of guilt or superiority.
*   **Consistent Practice**: Osho suggests trying this for **seven continuous days** to experience its transformative effect.

##### Commentaries and Insights

Osho provides extensive explanations and philosophical context for this method:

*   **The Nature of Unhappiness and Happiness**:
    *   **Unhappiness stems from excessive seriousness** about life.
    *   **Happiness is a consequence of viewing life as a play** and having a "festive mind". Once this happiness is experienced, one can choose to remain in it, as it becomes clear that unhappiness is a choice.
*   **Breaking Identification with Roles**:
    *   This technique is designed to **break our identification with the roles** (husband, shopkeeper, etc.) that society, culture, and circumstances impose upon us. We often mistake these roles for our true selves, leading to inner turmoil.
    *   By seeing life as a drama, one becomes an **actor playing roles**, rather than being consumed by them.
*   **Connection to "Dreaming" and "Reality" (Maya)**:
    *   Meditation, at its core, is the **transcending of the dreaming process**. We are constantly "dreaming" even when awake.
    *   Enlightenment, or "awakening," is the **cessation of this inner dreaming**. When inner dreaming stops, one experiences "pure space," "innocence," and "non-dreaming consciousness".
    *   Our "self-ignorance" is the state of being "asleep," where the "dreamer is lost in the dreaming" and we are aware of everything except ourselves.
    *   Shankara's concept of *maya* (the world as illusion or dream) is not a philosophical argument but a **meditative device**. By consistently remembering that the waking world is a dream, one can eventually remember this even in night dreams, leading to a "double-arrowed consciousness" where one becomes aware of the "dreamer" (the subject).
    *   Similarly, **Gurdjieff's "self-remembering"** ("I am") serves to make one aware of the self. If "I am" is remembered, dreams are perceived as dreams, and the so-called "reality" of the external world begins to appear as a dream. This leads to becoming a "buddha, an awakened one".
    *   An **enlightened person does not dream** because they are conscious even in sleep and have no "suspended" or "incomplete" experiences from their waking life to be resolved in dreams.
*   **The Unmoving Center**:
    *   Within the constantly changing periphery of life, there is an **innermost, eternally unmoving center**. The practice allows one to realize this center without needing to stop or change the external flux.
    *   A truly silent mind is one that is "unmoving" and can thus know reality.
*   **Personal Responsibility for Experience**:
    *   Our **thoughts and interpretations create our personal "world" or "milieu"**. If one believes traffic is disturbing, it will be; if one believes family life is a bondage, it will manifest as such.
    *   The liberated person ceases to "cause anything" and simply *is*, existing without misery or clinging to either bliss or suffering.
*   **Challenges and Warnings**:
    *   Initially, viewing life as a psychodrama may lead to feelings of **detachment and loneliness**. Osho advises to simply *feel* these sensations without trying to change them, as acceptance leads to their disappearance.
    *   Any "sincerity and depth" that can be *lost* by this technique was never truly real. True depth is unconditional and cannot be disturbed.
    *   It is crucial **not to practice these techniques mechanically**. A deep understanding is required, otherwise, one might achieve only a superficial, cultivated stillness rather than genuine inner purity.
    *   The mind is "tricky" and will provide excuses to avoid actually *doing* the practice, often by questioning its simplicity or feasibility. One should not trust the mind's rationalizations to escape action.
    *   The onset of inner clarity may initially reveal one's "anarchy," "madness," and "dark mess," which can be frightening. A master's guidance can be helpful at this point to prevent escape.
*   **Transformation and Liberation**:
    *   This technique leads to **inner purity** and **buddha-nature**.
    *   It allows one to become a **master of oneself**, rather than a slave to external circumstances or internal conflicts.
    *   The transformation is not a forced effort but a **spontaneous happening** that results from deep understanding. It allows for a joyful and creative existence.
    *   When the "false center" disappears and one is rooted in their "real center," the world is transformed from *maya* into *nirvana* (liberation).
    *   The process allows one to experience the inherent potential for divinity in all beings, leading to compassion rather than destruction.
