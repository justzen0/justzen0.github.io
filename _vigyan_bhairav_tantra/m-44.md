### A method for those with a sensitive ear

##### What the Method Is
The core instruction for this meditation technique is to **"Center on the sound 'aum' without any 'a' or 'm.'"**. This implies focusing specifically on the middle sound "u" within the combined "Aum".

##### How It Is Done
This technique is considered **difficult** and is primarily suitable for individuals who possess a **very sensitive ear**, such as musicians, poets, or those with a natural inclination for working with sound. For others, its delicate nature makes it challenging.

To practice this method, one should follow these steps:
*   **Initial Ear Training**: Before attempting the core practice, it is essential to train one's hearing if the ears are not already sensitive enough. This involves:
    *   **Intoning "Aum"** and becoming capable of **perceiving its three constituent sounds (a-u-m) separately** within the combined sound.
    *   Practices derived from Zen tradition are suggested for ear training. These include listening intently to natural sounds like **wind blowing** and discerning its various nuances (e.g., angry, furious, compassionate). Another example is **listening to a river** over extended periods, becoming attuned to its changing moods and subtle sonic differences throughout the year.
*   **Core Practice (Dropping 'a' and 'm')**: Once the ear has been sufficiently trained to distinguish the individual sounds within "Aum," the practitioner proceeds to **drop the "a" and "m" sounds**, concentrating solely on the remaining **"u" sound**.
*   **Intense Focus**: The effort required to maintain focus on this subtle middle sound ("u") is intended to be so engrossing that it leads to the **cessation of mental activity** or thinking. If the mind begins to think, the technique cannot be performed correctly.

##### Commentaries and Insights
*   **Indirect Path to No-Mind**: Osho describes this technique as an **indirect way to guide the practitioner beyond the mind** and into a state of "no-mind" or "soundlessness". While the instruction may seem simple, its execution is arduous and profound.
*   **Purpose Beyond Mantra**: The true objective of this practice is not merely the mantra or the manipulation of sounds, but the **cultivation of extreme sensitivity and intense awareness**.
*   **Connection to Zen Koans**: This method shares a conceptual link with Zen koans, such as **"the sound of one hand,"** which are also designed as indirect means to develop heightened awareness and sensitivity. The ultimate experience reached through such focus is a state where only awareness or sensitivity itself remains, devoid of any specific object.
*   **Mind as Sound**: Tantra and Yoga understand the mind as fundamentally a **process of thought and sound**. When all sounds cease, the mind itself ceases to exist. Thus, soundlessness is synonymous with the state of no-mind, which is the ultimate goal of meditation.
*   **Aum as a Fundamental Sound**: "Aum" is presented as a primal sound, a synthesis of "a," "u," and "m." These three sounds are considered basic building blocks from which all other sounds are derived, akin to fundamental particles in physics.
*   **Using Mind to Transcend Mind**: In contrast to philosophies that advocate against using the mind to go beyond it (like Sankhya or Krishnamurti's teachings), Yoga and Tantra propose that the **mind can be utilized as a "jumping board"** for transcendence. Sound, being a basic component of the mind, can be trained and then used to plunge into the state of soundlessness/no-mind.
*   **Transformative Power of Alertness**: The transformation experienced through this technique is a direct result of the mind becoming so intensely focused on a subtle internal phenomenon that it ceases thinking. This heightened state of alertness leads to a profound shift in one's being.
*   **Potential Challenges**:
    *   **Maintaining Alertness**: A significant challenge is the difficulty in sustaining alertness. Many people mistakenly believe they are aware but are in a state of sleep or unconsciousness.
    *   **Risk of Hypnosis/Sleep**: Repetitive or monotonous chanting, even of a mantra, can induce boredom and lead to sleep. This is a major obstacle to spiritual awakening as it becomes a form of "auto-hypnosis" or "yoga tandra," a tranquilizing effect rather than true meditation. It is crucial to **actively listen** to the mantra while intoning it to avoid falling asleep.
    *   **Distinguishing Meditation from Sleep**: A key insight is that while a hypnotic or yoga tandra sleep can be calming and refreshing, it differs fundamentally from meditation. In true meditation, the observer or reasoning mind remains fully awake and alert, even as the body rests, whereas in sleep or hypnosis, this "watcher" is dormant.
*   **Soundfulness vs. Soundlessness**: Osho clarifies that while the result can be described as "soundlessness" (as Buddha might say, equating it to nirvana), Tantra often uses the term **"soundfulness"** when describing the ultimate state, emphasizing its positive, all-encompassing nature. Both terms, though seemingly contradictory, point to the same profound reality where sound dissolves into a unified, non-dual experience.
*   **Importance of Master's Guidance**: Due to the subtle and potentially impactful nature of mantras, particularly those that engage deep psychological layers, Osho stresses the importance of receiving mantras from a **master who understands their precise effects**. Misuse of certain sounds can even be dangerous, leading to unintended and harmful psychological states, such as a desire for death.
*   **Historical and Cultural Context**: This technique is rooted in traditions where music and dance were originally meditative practices aimed at helping practitioners and audiences connect with the central essence of sound, leading to states of samadhi or ecstasy. Ancient teachings were often kept secret to prevent misuse, as it was believed that unready individuals might turn awakening techniques into means of inducing sleep.
