### Realize the oneness of existence

##### What the method is

The method of "Realize the oneness of existence" is deeply rooted in the Tantric understanding of non-duality, where distinctions and divisions are ultimately seen as illusions of the mind. The core instruction that embodies this method is: **"As waves come with water and flames with fire, so the universal waves with us."** This sutra posits that just as individual waves are not separate from the ocean, and flames are not separate from fire, human beings are fundamentally inseparable from the cosmic, universal existence. The method aims to shift one's perception from a fragmented, individualistic view to a unified, interconnected experience of reality.

##### How it is done

This method involves a **shift in perception and a deep meditative understanding of one's fundamental interconnectedness with the cosmos**:

- **Contemplate the Nature of a Wave**: Begin by understanding that a wave, though it appears to exist individually, is not separate from the ocean; it is merely a form, not a substance. The deeper reality is always the ocean itself.
- **Apply to Personal Existence**: Extend this understanding to your own being. **"Start feeling your breathing as just the rising of a wave."**. Recognize that the breath entering you was previously part of someone else and will become part of another, emphasizing the continuous flow and shared nature of life.
- **Dissolve Individuality and Ego**: Consciously work to realize that individuality is "false and illusory" and that **"the ego is the only barrier"** to this realization. The true nature is "non-individual, the oceanic, the togetherness".
- **Shift Focus from Self to Cosmos**: Practice perceiving events not as happening _to you_ as a separate entity, but as happening _to the cosmos_ through you. For instance, when hungry or thirsty, feel that "the universal feels hungry through me" or "The existence is thirsty within me". This involves **"leaving everything to the Universe"**.
- **"Remember the Ocean and Forget the Wave"**: This is a key practice. Instead of identifying with your individual "wave" form, focus your awareness on the underlying "ocean" of existence. This re-establishes a connection to the boundless and deathless aspect of being.
- **Live in the Moment without Mental Constructs**: The mind creates problems by dividing and imposing interpretations on reality, which is inherently simple and unproblematic. By remaining with facts and not judging them as pure or impure, one allows the mental divisions to dissolve.

##### Commentaries and Insights

- **Mind as the Source of Duality and Misery**: Osho emphasizes that the **mind inherently divides and creates dualities** (e.g., life and death, good and bad, pure and impure), preventing direct perception of indivisible reality. This division leads to conflict and suffering. The world appears "problematic" because we perceive it through the mind's filters.
- **Ego and Fear of Death**: The **ego, born from the illusion of individuality**, is the root of suffering and the fear of death. When one identifies solely with the "wave" (individual form), the fear of its inevitable dissolution arises. Realizing oneness with the "ocean" (universal existence) eradicates this fear, as the ocean itself does not die.
- **Acceptance as Transformation**: Tantra's central teaching is **total acceptance** of oneself and existence as it is, without judgment or condemnation. This **"no-fight"** attitude dissolves inner divisions and accumulates energy, leading to "total transformation". Acceptance is not passive resignation but an active **transcendence**.
- **Bliss and Liberation (Samadhi)**: When one deeply participates in existence without mental divisions, **bliss** is possible. This state, known as _samadhi_, is described as an "oceanic feeling" where the individual center dissolves into the cosmos, leading to **omnipresence**. It is a state of "no-mind," where the boundaries of the ego disappear.
- **Beyond Moral Judgments**: Tantra moves beyond conventional morality, stating that nothing is inherently "pure" or "impure". The only "impurity" is sleepiness, or unawareness, while "alertness is pure". This liberation from judgment allows for deeper acceptance and inner unity.
- **Connection to Other Traditions**:
    - **Buddha**: While Buddha spoke of "no misery" rather than "bliss," both indicate the same state of profound liberation achieved by dissolving the self. His emphasis on the "middle path" aligns with Tantra's non-extreme approach.
    - **Shankara (Advaita Vedanta)**: Shankara's philosophy of _maya_ (illusion) is seen as an experiential truth for one centered in the "third eye" where dream and reality merge. His concept of "I am all" means the self has dissolved into the totality, mirroring Buddha's "I am no more".
    - **Zen**: Zen masters like Dogen demonstrate this oneness by experiencing hunger or thirst as the universal doing so through them. The Zen concept of "ordinary mind is the buddha-mind" also aligns, emphasizing awareness in simple, everyday actions.
    - **Yoga**: While Yoga also uses techniques, its approach often involves struggle and suppression. Tantra, conversely, emphasizes **indulgence with awareness** and **affirmation** of all aspects of being as a path to transcendence. Tantra is seen as a "love technique" that makes one with existence through deep participation.
- **Effort and Spontaneity**: While effort is needed initially to break identification and dissolve barriers, the ultimate realization of oneness is **not a causal phenomenon**; it is already the case, requiring only a shift in awareness to be recognized. The more one moves effortlessly, the easier the realization happens.
- **The Guru's Role**: A master's role is to help shatter illusions, revealing the underlying reality. The ultimate transmission of spiritual truth can happen in moments of complete emptiness and receptivity, transcending words.
