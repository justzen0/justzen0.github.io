### Feel yourself saturated

##### What the method is

The meditation method is titled "**Feel yourself saturated**". While the provided sources do not offer a direct, detailed explanation of this specific technique, based on the general principles of Tantric meditation discussed by Osho, it likely refers to a practice where one aims to achieve an internal state of being completely filled or permeated. This sensation could involve energy, light, a deep sense of wholeness, or a profound connection with existence, akin to becoming one with the universal.

##### How it is done

The precise steps for practicing "Feel yourself saturated" are not explicitly outlined in the provided texts. However, drawing from general Tantric meditation practices described, the execution would typically involve:

- **Comfortable Posture and Motionlessness**: Begin by **sitting comfortably with your eyes closed**, ideally in a stable posture with a straight spine, such as padmasana or siddhasana. It is crucial to **keep your body motionless** to avoid distraction and facilitate deeper focus, allowing for the flow of energy.
- **Inner Focus and Visualization (Inferred)**: Many Tantric techniques emphasize the power of imagination and visualization. To achieve a state of "saturation," one might internally conceptualize or **imagine your entire being as composed of light rays** or energy. This imagination is rooted in the Tantric understanding that everything, including oneself, fundamentally consists of light particles or energy. The practice would then involve directing attention inward to feel this essence or energy filling and permeating every part of one's being, leading to a sense of being completely "saturated" or overflowing.
- **Total Acceptance**: A fundamental aspect of Tantra is **total acceptance**. While practicing, one should not fight or resist any sensations or thoughts that arise, but rather allow them to be. This non-resistance is key to letting energies flow naturally and for the experience of saturation to unfold effortlessly.

##### Commentaries and Insights

As a detailed commentary on "Feel yourself saturated" is not explicitly available in the given sources, the following insights are derived from Osho's broader discussions on Tantric philosophy and meditation, and may be applicable to this technique:

- **The Path of Acceptance and Non-Duality**: Tantra emphasizes **total acceptance** of oneself and all energies within, including those often condemned like anger or sex, viewing them as raw material for transformation. The concept of "saturation" aligns with this non-dualistic approach, where one accepts and embraces their entire being without division, leading to a profound sense of unity and fullness. This is in contrast to Yoga, which often involves fighting or suppressing aspects of oneself.
- **Transcendence of Mind and Ego**: The ultimate aim of Tantric techniques is to **go beyond the mind** and its constant activity, leading to a state of no-mind. When one is truly "saturated" in meditation, the individual ego and its concerns dissolve, allowing for a state of deep fulfillment and peace. This process moves beyond intellectual understanding to an **existential experience** where the "doer" disappears, and everything simply "happens".
- **Experience of "Livingness" and Cosmic Connection**: When internal energies, such as Kundalini, rise through the spinal centers (chakras) and permeate the being, practitioners may experience a **rising warmth, an inward light, and a new sense of "livingness"**. Feeling "saturated" could be an intense manifestation of this awakened energy, culminating in a profound feeling of being interconnected with the entire cosmos, where the individual drop merges into the ocean. The sensation of fulfillment is so complete that "not even God is needed".
- **Importance of Feeling and Sensitivity**: Osho repeatedly stresses the need to develop sensitivity and "feeling" beyond mere intellectual understanding for these techniques to be effective. "Feeling saturated" necessitates this heightened sensory and emotional awareness, as opposed to just thinking about being saturated. It is about a qualitative, internal experience rather than a mental concept.
- **The Role of Imagination**: While the process begins with imagination, Tantra suggests that because all existence fundamentally consists of light and energy, **imagination can become potent** when one's attention is focused at higher energy centers like the third eye. What is imagined can become actual, leading to profound inner phenomena and transformation.
- **Warnings and Master's Guidance**: As with many powerful Tantric meditations, particularly those involving the direct raising of Kundalini, it is emphasized that one must **not leave the energy "in the middle"** of the body, as this can be harmful. The energy, once activated, should be allowed to rise fully to the crown chakra (Sahasrara) and be released into the cosmos. The importance of practicing such powerful techniques under the **guidance of a master** is also highlighted, or to stop if discomfort becomes unbearable, to avoid creating mental illnesses or fear.
