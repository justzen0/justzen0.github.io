### Intone a word ending in “AH”

##### What the Method Is
The core instruction for this meditation technique is: "**Silently intone a word ending in “ah.” Then in the “hh,” effortlessly, the spontaneity.**". This method emphasizes focusing on the outgoing breath and the subtle sounds associated with it, particularly the "ah" sound at the end of exhalation. It is characterized by Osho as a "**death method**".

##### How It Is Done
This technique leverages the natural process of breathing to lead to inner silence and awareness. The steps are as follows:
*   **Choose a word ending in "ah"**: Any word that naturally concludes with an "ah" sound can be used, such as "Allah" or simply the sound "Ah" itself.
*   **Intone silently**: The chosen word or sound is to be intoned **silently**. While initial loud intonation can help attunement, the focus for this specific technique is internal and subtle.
*   **Emphasize exhaling**: Consciously **emphasize the outgoing breath**. The goal is to completely empty yourself of breath, allowing nothing to remain within. You are to force the breath out, allowing the body to inhale on its own without conscious effort.
*   **Feel the "hh" sound**: As breath silently comes in (inhaling), **feel the subtle "hh" sound**. This requires deep alertness, as it's a very silent and slightly audible sound. It starts from the tongue, can be felt in the throat, and ultimately in the heart. The instruction for the "hh" sound implies keeping the mouth slightly open, as if about to speak.
*   **Observe the interval**: After exhaling completely, **observe the inner calm and silence** in the momentary gap before the next breath comes in.
*   **Practice anywhere**: This technique can be practiced **any moment**, such as while riding in a bus or train, or moving to the office.

##### Commentaries and Insights
*   **The Nature of Breath and Life/Death**: Osho explains that the outgoing breath is associated with **silence and relaxation**, akin to death, while the incoming breath is linked to tension and life. The technique uses this natural association, making you "empty and dead" for a moment when all breath has moved out. This acceptance of death makes one **open and capable of true life**, as fear disappears.
*   **Achieving Inner Calm**: When the body is emptied of breath, it touches a point of silence that is otherwise inaccessible. This process leads to a **different quality of calm, at-easeness, and tranquility**.
*   **Transformation Beyond Duality**: Realizing this emptiness and silence allows for a complete transformation, revealing the **witnessing soul** that is beyond life and death. Catching this moment offers a glimpse of what enlightened beings like Buddha experienced. The inherent problems of life—anxiety, anguish, anger—belong to life, not to death, which is "non-problematic".
*   **Mind-Body Connection**: Tantra sees the body and mind as interconnected. By working with the breath, which is within reach, one can influence deeper physiological and psychological states. Emphasizing exhalation can lead to improvements in physical conditions like constipation and heart disease, and generally makes the mind simpler and less complex.
*   **Spontaneity and Effortless Being**: The ultimate goal is to achieve "spontaneity" and an effortless state. While an initial effort may be required to begin the practice, the intention is to move beyond effort into a state of pure being where inner harmony is naturally felt.
*   **Sound and Silence**: The technique serves as a **bridge from thought to no-thought**, and from mind to no-mind. Sound is seen as foundational to mind, and by subtly navigating sound into soundlessness or "soundfulness" (a Tantric positive term for the absolute, akin to Buddha's "nothingness"), one dissolves into total awareness. This method uses sound to communicate with the other, while soundlessness facilitates turning inward to oneself.
*   **Avoiding Hypnosis**: Osho warns that repetitive sounds can act as tranquilizers and lead to sleep or a hypnotic state (yoga tandra). To prevent this, the practitioner must remain **alert and actively listen** to the sound while intoning it, especially as it becomes subtler.
*   **Tantric Acceptance**: This method operates within Tantra's fundamental principle of **total acceptance**. Instead of fighting or suppressing natural processes, Tantra uses them for transformation. Accepting the world as it is, as fate, releases energy for inner penetration. This distinguishes Tantra from teachings that emphasize negation or struggle against aspects of life.
*   **No Fixed Ideals**: Tantra offers techniques for self-discovery rather than prescribing ideals. It suggests that your own inner potentiality will actualize, unique to you, and no external ideal needs to be imitated.
*   **Scientific Approach**: Osho consistently describes Tantra as a science of inner transformation, akin to physics, focusing on "how" to attain truth rather than "what" truth is. The "simple" techniques are deeply profound, touching the basic realities of existence.
*   **Personal Application**: It is crucial to feel an affinity with a technique for it to be effective. While these are generalized methods, a master's initiation can offer a more tailored and potent approach.
