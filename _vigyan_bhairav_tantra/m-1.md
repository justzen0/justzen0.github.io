### Watch the gap between two breaths

##### What the Method Is

The core instruction for this meditation technique is: "**Radiant one, this experience may dawn between two breaths. After breath comes in (down) and just before turning up (out) â€“ the beneficence**". This implies that a profound spiritual happening or "beneficence" is possible within the brief, often unperceived **gap between an incoming and an outgoing breath**.

##### How It Is Done

To practice this method, Osho emphasizes that it is a scientific technique that does not require training or systematizing the breath, unlike traditional Yoga. Instead, it focuses on **awareness of certain points in the breathing process** as it naturally occurs.

The practical steps involve:

- **Observe natural breathing**: Do not try to train or manipulate your breath; simply let it be as it is.
- **Become aware of the incoming breath**: Begin by watching your breath as it comes in, paying close attention to its entire passage.
- **Synchronize consciousness with breath**: Move fully consciously with the breath as it goes in. Do not get ahead of it or fall behind; instead, aim for breath and consciousness to become one, moving simultaneously.
- **Identify the momentary pause**: Observe for the **brief instant when the incoming breath stops** before turning outward, and similarly, when the outgoing breath stops before turning inward. This gap is typically of a very short duration.
- **Focus on the breath, not just the passage**: Initially, you may only be aware of the touch of breath at your nostrils or the sensation of it moving through the passage. The first step is to become aware of this physical touch and passage, and gradually, your sensitivity will grow to perceive the breath itself, and then the subtle gap.
- **Practice in dedicated periods**: In the beginning, it is advisable to practice this exercise during specific periods, such as for an hour in the morning or evening, without engaging in other activities. This allows your attention to fully focus on the breathing.
- **Expand awareness gradually**: Over time, as you become more attuned, you can extend this awareness to simple daily activities like walking, becoming a watcher of both the activity and your breath simultaneously. Eventually, you may even become aware of your breath continuously, even in sleep.

##### Commentaries and Insights

- **Path to the Present Moment**: This technique is fundamentally **non-intellectual**; it is a doing, not a thinking process. Its practice is intended to **turn the mind from its usual journeys into the past or future and bring it suddenly into the present**. When the mind is fully in the present, it stops, leading to a state of **no-mind**. In this "here and now," truth, freedom, and nirvana are revealed.
- **Breath as a Bridge**: Osho explains that breath acts as a crucial **bridge** between the individual and the universe, and also between the individual self and time and space. The technique uses this bridge to transcend ordinary perception and connect with the source of life, allowing one to be both _in_ the world and _beyond_ it.
- **Symbolism of Breath Cycles**: For Tantra, each outgoing breath is considered a **death**, and each incoming breath a **rebirth**. The gap between these breaths represents a momentary "death" where one is briefly "not in the world," making the happening (enlightenment) possible.
- **Connection to Buddhism (Anapanasati Yoga)**: This particular method is famously known as **Anapanasati Yoga** in Buddhist terminology, through which Buddha attained enlightenment. While Buddha taught awareness of incoming and outgoing breaths, he did not explicitly mention focusing on the gap, believing that a direct focus on the gap might create desire and distract from pure awareness. However, if one consistently practices breath awareness, the gap will be discovered automatically as awareness deepens.
- **Tantra vs. Yoga Approach**: While Yoga also uses breath work, it aims to systematize it for health and longevity. Tantra, conversely, is not concerned with systematization but uses breath as a **technique to turn inward** and become aware of specific points within the natural breathing process.
- **Simplicity vs. Depth**: The technique appears deceptively simple because it can be described in a few sentences. However, its actual practice is **arduous** and requires **keen observation and sincere attention**. The human mind, being cunning, often dismisses simple methods because it is drawn to difficulty, which feeds the ego. True simplicity, however, touches fundamental realities.
- **Mind's Resistance and Fear**: The mind tends to create problems and deceptions, making the seemingly simple difficult. This includes suggesting that such a small effort cannot lead to enlightenment or creating excuses like lack of time. **Fear of the unknown** and the prospect of the "small self" vanishing into absolute nothingness (emptiness or _shunya_) can also create internal resistance. Osho advises against being overly trusting of the mind and emphasizes that the goal is not to accumulate knowledge but to experience transformation.
- **Signs of Progress**: As the technique begins to "click," one may feel a **different identity** and a sense of strangeness about oneself, indicating transformation. Ultimately, this leads to an inner **flowering of silence**, a real harmony with the universe, rather than mere adjustment. Initially, this heightened awareness might reveal inner "anarchy" and "madness," which can be fearful, highlighting the importance of a master's guidance.
- **Impact on Mind and Body**: When breath stops, the mind also stops, demonstrating the deep connection between physiological and psychological processes. **Mind movement requires breath movement** (e.g., faster breath during anger or sex). When the mind is pure and free of desire, breathing stops automatically, leading to the vanishing of the "small self" and the attainment of the higher self.
- **Authenticity and Practice**: The effectiveness of the technique depends on authentic practice, even if it feels difficult at first. Starting with easier aspects and gradually building awareness is crucial, rather than becoming discouraged by initial struggles.
