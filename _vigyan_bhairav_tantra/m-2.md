### Watch the turning point between two breaths

##### What the Method Is
The core instruction for this meditation technique, as described by Shiva, is: "**As breath turns from down to up, and again as breath curves from up to down – through both these turns, realize**". This means focusing awareness precisely on the moments when the incoming breath changes direction to become outgoing, and vice versa.

##### How It Is Done
To practice this method, you should:
*   **Observe the breath as a continuous circle:** Recognize that breathing in and out is not two parallel lines, but rather forms a continuous circle. The breath comes in (down) and then turns to go out (up), and similarly, the outgoing breath turns to become incoming.
*   **Focus on the turning points:** Direct your attention to the **exact moment the breath changes direction**. This is the subtle point where the incoming breath becomes outgoing, and where the outgoing breath becomes incoming.
*   **Maintain minute observation:** This turning point is of very short duration and requires **very minute observation**. It is not easy to observe, as the human mind often jumps from one thought to another rather than staying with a single focus.
*   **Remain without verbalization:** True observation means "remaining with no word, with no verbalization, with no bubbling inside – just remaining with" the turning point of the breath.
*   **Cultivate alertness:** The goal is to cultivate a deep sense of alertness and awareness that can perceive these subtle moments.

##### Commentaries and Insights
*   **Subtle Difference from "Watch the Gap":** This technique is closely related to "Watch the gap between two breaths" but with a slight, yet significant, difference. While the previous technique emphasizes the momentary *stop* between breaths, this one emphasizes the *turning* point itself, where the breath changes direction.
*   **Analogy of Neutral Gear:** Osho explains this turning point using the analogy of a car's neutral gear. Just as a car must pass through neutral gear when changing from one gear to another, the breath passes through a "neutral territory" or turning point between inhalation and exhalation.
*   **Significance of the Turn for Realization:** Shiva emphasizes realizing these turns because it is in these moments that "the breath leaves you to move in a different direction". At the turning point, you are not joined with the breath, and the breath is separate from you. This is where you can become aware of "who you are".
*   **Separation from Body and Mind:** At these turning points, if breathing is life, you are momentarily "dead"; if breathing is your body, you are "no-body"; if breathing is your mind, you are "no-mind". This momentary detachment from the physical and mental processes allows for the realization of one's true being, transcending the mechanisms of the body and mind.
*   **Challenge of Observation and the "Monkey Mind":** Human beings generally lack the capacity for such keen observation. The mind is likened to a "monkey mind" that constantly jumps and cannot sit still, making it difficult to remain focused on a single point without internal "bubbling" or verbalization. This technique requires overcoming this habitual mental restlessness.
*   **Connection to Zazen:** The practice of "just sitting" (Zazen) in Japan is a method to counter the monkey mind, encouraging stillness without internal movement, which can lead to entering the inner self or the beyond within.
*   **Simplicity vs. Depth:** While the instruction appears simple, its execution is profound and demanding. It looks simple because it is expressed in a few sentences, but like an atomic formula, its simplicity hides immense power. Achieving true awareness of these subtle points is not easy and requires deep sensitivity and persistent effort.
*   **Path to the Present Moment:** The overall purpose of breath-related techniques in Tantra is to bring the mind into the present moment. When the mind is fully in the present, it stops, leading to a state of "no-mind".
*   **Not Yoga:** Osho stresses that while Yoga also works on breath, Tantra's approach is different. Yoga systematizes breathing for health and longevity, whereas Tantra uses breath as a technique **just to turn inward**, without needing to practice a particular style or rhythm of breathing. Tantra is concerned with becoming aware of certain subtle points in natural breathing, not controlling it.
