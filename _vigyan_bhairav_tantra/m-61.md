### Experience existence as wave-ing

##### What the Method Is

The core instruction or sutra for this method is: "**As waves come with water and flames with fire, so the universal waves with us**". This sutra invites contemplation on the nature of existence, equating individual beings and experiences to temporary forms (waves) of an underlying, boundless reality (the ocean).

##### How It Is Done

To practice "Experience existence as wave-ing", the guidance suggests a deep meditative approach:

*   **Contemplate the Nature of a Wave**: Begin by deeply understanding what a wave is. Acknowledge that a wave *appears* to exist, but in a deeper sense, it is merely a **form** or an **activity** of the ocean, not a separate substance. The ocean is the true reality; the wave is just a temporary play.
*   **Apply the Metaphor to Self and Existence**: **Meditate on the idea that "we are just waves in a cosmic ocean"**. Allow this feeling to penetrate deeply within your being.
*   **Focus on Breathing as Waving**: Start by **feeling your breathing as the rising and falling of a wave**.
    *   As you **breathe in**, feel a wave rising.
    *   As you **breathe out**, feel a wave dying.
    *   Recognise that the breath entering you was someone else's a moment before, and the breath leaving you will become someone else's next, highlighting the **shared, continuous nature of life**.
*   **Dissolve Individuality into the Ocean**: Through this observation, question your separate identity. **"You are not separate – just waves. You are one deep down."**.
*   **Embrace Nothingness (Shunya)**: In the **gap between the incoming and outgoing breath**, become aware of a **"nothingness, shunya – a void"**. This void is your real, unburdened centre, leading to deep ease.
*   **Extend the Feeling to All Experiences**: Apply this perspective to all life experiences. For instance, when a **sex desire arises**, feel it not as *your* desire, but as **"the ocean waving in you, just as life pulsating"**. Similarly, in a **love act**, perceive it not as two individuals meeting, but as **two individuals merging**, where "waves have disappeared; only the ocean has remained".
*   **Witness without Identification**: Throughout, **"think yourself as a wave, or as a continuum of waves rising and falling, and just be a witness to this"**. Realise that the wave form is not substantial and is constantly changing and dying, while the formless ocean is deathless.

##### Commentaries and Insights

Osho's insights illuminate the profound implications of this Tantric method:

*   **Reality as Non-Dual (Advait)**: Tantra inherently views existence as **indivisible and non-dual**, where apparent distinctions like wave and ocean are merely forms of the same underlying reality. The concept that "waving" is an activity, not a separate thing, helps transcend the mind's tendency to fragment reality. This contrasts with dualistic philosophies that perceive fundamental separation.
*   **The Ego as the Barrier**: The **ego is the primary barrier** to experiencing this oneness. When the "wave thinks itself separate from the ocean, the fear of death will immediately come" and "misery needs a center – and a false center at that". Clinging to individuality, or the "wave form," creates constant misery and anxiety because the wave is inherently mortal and impermanent.
*   **Transformation through Acceptance, not Conflict**: Tantra's central teaching is **"no-fight"**; it advocates for **total acceptance** and flowing with nature, rather than struggling against it. When you **accept yourself totally**, including all your "animal energies" like sex, anger, and greed, you are **"thrown to your inner centre"** and transcend the experience. This total acceptance allows the inner division (e.g., between saint and animal) to dissolve, leading to unity and a profound peace.
*   **Mind, Maya, and Unreality**: The mind creates divisions and defines boundaries, leading to a perception of reality as fragmented. This is akin to Shankara's concept of **Maya (illusion)**, where the world is seen as an appearance, a reflection, rather than the ultimate truth. Living within the mind's reflections, we become "unreal" and "shallow". This meditation aims to help one **"move away from the mind so that you can move into reality"**.
*   **The Goal: Samadhi and Oneness**: Centering is the **"path, not the goal"** to samadhi. While the method helps you gather your energy at one point, the ultimate experience is an "explosion" where your individual centre dissolves, and you become **"one with the cosmos"**. In this state, there is **"no center – or then the center is everywhere"**. This "oceanic feeling is samadhi" – a profound realisation of oneness with the whole of existence.
*   **Consequences of Realisation**:
    *   **Dissolving Misery and Fear**: When you are no longer identified with the limited wave, but with the boundless ocean, **"all your misery will disappear"**. The fundamental fear of death, which underpins all anxieties, vanishes.
    *   **Bliss and Ease**: Without the individual ego to create tension, there is a **"deep ease"** and **"bliss is"**. This state is not an attainment to be hoped for, but a natural consequence of letting go of illusions.
    *   **Authenticity and Non-Responsibility (Spiritual Sense)**: When your ego dissolves, "sin will be impossible because sin can happen only around an ego". This doesn't mean becoming irresponsible in a worldly sense, but rather, one's actions naturally align with the cosmic flow, leading to creative outcomes and compassion, much like a Buddha or Mahavira.
    *   **"No-mind" State**: By dissolving the identification with the mental process, one enters a state of "no-mind". This isn't an absence of thought, but a state where the mind becomes an instrument rather than the master, allowing one to live in the **"eternal now"**.
*   **Simplicity and Danger**: Despite its profound effects, the technique itself appears "so simple". However, this simplicity often deters the ego, which seeks difficult challenges for self-fulfillment. Osho stresses that these "simple" methods are powerful because they touch fundamental truths. He also warns that such powerful techniques, especially those leading to a deep experience of energy shifts, **should be completed fully and not left "in the middle," as it can be harmful**. While he presents general methods, personal **initiation from a master** can provide tailored guidance and energy transmission for deeper, safer practice.
