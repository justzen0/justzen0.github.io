### Feel the satisfaction

##### What the Method Is

The core instruction or sutra is: **"Wherever satisfaction is found, in whatever act, actualize this."**. This means to fully engage with and become the feeling of satisfaction arising from any act, rather than letting it be a fleeting experience.

##### How It Is Done

To effectively practise "Feel the satisfaction," the steps involve:

*   **Identify moments of satisfaction**: Observe and recognise instances where you experience subtle satisfaction in daily life. An example given is the relief and contentment felt after drinking water when thirsty.
*   **Focus on the feeling, not the cause**: Once a feeling of satisfaction arises, **"forget the water, forget the thirst"** or the external cause of that satisfaction. The emphasis is purely on the internal, subtle feeling itself.
*   **Actualise the satisfaction**: Instead of allowing the satisfaction to be a passing phase, **"remain with the subtle satisfaction that you are feeling"**. Actively **"be filled with it; simply feel satisfied"**.
*   **Become one with the feeling**: The goal is to **"actualize this, feel it, become one with it"**. This means a complete, non-verbal immersion in the state of contentment, transcending any mental analysis or external labels.

##### Commentaries and Insights

Osho's commentaries offer extensive insights into the nature and practice of "Feel the satisfaction":

*   **Positive approach and reversal of ordinary mind**: This technique introduces a **"positive approach"** and a **"total reversal to the ordinary mind and its process"**. The typical human mind is often **"mischievous"** and tends to focus on dissatisfactions and discontent, rarely fully embracing or even noticing moments of satisfaction. This method re-orients the mind towards the positive aspects of existence.
*   **Windows to existence**: Osho explains that every experience is like a **"window"**. While identifying with pain opens a window to "hell," becoming one with a **"satisfactory moment, a blissful moment, an ecstatic moment"** opens a window towards a **"greater positive existence"**.
*   **Tantra's acceptance and amoral stance**: This technique aligns with Tantra's fundamental principle of **total acceptance** of what is, without moral judgment. Tantra is **"amoral"**, not concerned with ideals or what *should* be, but with the direct experience of "what is". This acceptance leads to a deep relaxation and transformation, as energy is no longer wasted in internal conflict or resistance.
*   **Not a mental process, but a feeling**: Similar to "Self-remembering," this method is not about verbalising or thinking about satisfaction (e.g., repeating "I am satisfied"). It is a **"non-verbal feeling"** that transcends intellectual processes and mental repetition, which can often lead to a tranquilised, sleepy state rather than genuine awareness.
*   **Importance of sensitivity and feeling**: For this and other Tantric techniques to be effective, one must **develop their feeling dimension and sensitivity**. Modern individuals often have **"lost feeling completely"** and intellectualise experiences, which hinders true transformation. Practising simple acts with full sensation – like feeling water during a shower or listening to sounds without analysis – can re-awaken this crucial sensitivity.
*   **Indirect approach to bliss**: Spiritual phenomena like bliss and enlightenment **"cannot be grabbed directly"**. They are **"by-products"** that arise when one is **"totally in the act"**, absorbed in the doing, rather than being concerned with the result. Being solely focused on the outcome can create a barrier to the experience itself.
*   **Simplicity and the ego**: The apparent simplicity of this technique can be a **"deception"** that the mind and ego try to dismiss. The ego is often **"interested in something which is difficult"**, seeing challenges as opportunities for self-validation. However, techniques that don't appeal to the ego are precisely those that foster genuine spiritual growth and can lead to transformation **"in this very moment here and now"**.
*   **Transformation through present awareness**: The method helps to bring one into the **"here and now"**, diverting consciousness from distractions of the past or future. This shift in awareness leads to a transformation, as **"the more intense the awareness, the less the possibility for dreaming"**. An individual's current **"absent existence"** is the fundamental disease, and Tantric techniques aim to make one **"more present"**.
