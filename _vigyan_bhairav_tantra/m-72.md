### Feel the presence of the ever-living existence

##### What the Method Is

The core instruction for this method is: "**Feel the cosmos as a translucent ever-living presence.**" This technique is explicitly concerned with **light** and the perception of all existence as being permeated by it. It encourages the practitioner to perceive the universe not as a collection of separate objects, but as a living, glowing, and unified entity.

##### How It Is Done

To practise this method, you should:

*   **Posture and Focus**: While the specific posture isn't detailed for this technique, it's generally implied that one should **sit comfortably**, possibly with eyes closed initially to facilitate inner visualisation. However, the instruction "Look at it!" suggests that the practice can also involve **open-eyed observation** of the external world.
*   **Perceive the Universe as Light**: Begin by understanding that "Everywhere light is – in many, many shapes, forms, light is happening everywhere". The world isn't just matter; it's fundamentally composed of light, a concept also affirmed by Tantra.
*   **Observational Practice**: **Look** at objects around you, such as "a leaf or a flower or a rock". The instruction is to look with patience and without hurry, allowing your perception to deepen until you start to "**feel rays coming out of it**". This is not about active imagination but about waiting silently for this subtle perception to emerge. Rushing will make you "dull" and prevent the revelation.
*   **Cultivate Sensitivity**: To enhance the effectiveness of this practice, Osho recommends engaging in "other sensitivity training". This includes:
    *   **Physical Touch**: Take someone's hand, close your eyes, and **feel the life** in the other person, allowing it to move towards you, and your own life towards them. Similarly, touch the bark of a tree and **feel the life** arising within it, observing how you change immediately.
    *   **Body Awareness**: Consciously feel every drop of water while showering, noting its touch, coldness, or warmth. **Feel your own body** all over, touching it in a loving way, as this increases sensitivity. Massage (with a friend) can also enhance sensitivity.
    *   **Breath Awareness**: Simply **feel the breath** – its movement within and its exit – without mental labelling.
*   **Consistent Practice**: Practice this method for at least **three months** to experience a significant transformation in your perception of the world.
*   **Non-Interference**: Do not impose interpretations or expectations. Just **wait silently** and allow the phenomenon to unfold.

##### Commentaries and Insights

*   **World's True Nature (LSD Analogy)**: Osho highlights that the world is inherently "a rainbow of colors – a mystery of colors and translucent light". The reason we don't perceive it this way is because our **senses have become dull**. He uses the analogy of LSD, stating that drugs don't create this colourful world but merely temporarily remove the dullness of perception, revealing the world as it already is.
*   **Impact on Mind and Being**: As you "feel the presence of the ever-living existence," your **mind will become completely silent**. This deep silence leads to a feeling of being "just a part in it, just a note in the great symphony". In this state, there's "No burden, no tension…the drop has fallen into the ocean". This is connected to the state of 'no-mind', where conscious thought ceases, and one experiences deep inner peace.
*   **Physiological Transformation**: This method isn't just mental; by feeling the world as filled with light and life, you actively **change your body chemistry**. This initiates a **chain reaction**: the altered body chemistry allows you to perceive the world as more alive, which further enhances the body's changes, leading to a continuous transformation.
*   **Preparation for Sudden Enlightenment**: While the visible process of this meditation is gradual, it serves to **prepare you for a sudden, non-causal spiritual explosion (samadhi)**. The techniques don't *cause* enlightenment but make you *ready* for it to happen, much like death is a sudden, not gradual, event.
*   **Beyond Duality and Ego**: Perceiving the cosmos as a translucent, ever-living presence helps transcend the ego, which is seen as the main barrier to experiencing reality. When the ego dissolves, there is no longer a separate "I" but a feeling of **oneness with the cosmos**, leading to omnipresence – where "the center is everywhere" or "nowhere". This acceptance of unity is a core tenet of Tantra.
*   **Tantra as Science, not Philosophy**: Osho clarifies that Tantra is a "science," a methodology focused on "how" to attain truth through experience, rather than "why" questions or philosophical doctrines. This technique embodies that scientific, experimental approach.
*   **The Power of Simple Techniques**: Despite its seeming simplicity, Osho stresses that this method is **profoundly powerful** because it touches fundamental realities of existence. The ego tends to dismiss simple practices in favour of arduous ones that provide a sense of achievement, but true transformation often comes from embracing the simple.
*   **Connection to Other Concepts**: This technique resonates with the awakening of the **third eye**, which, when unblocked, allows for a vision of "light without a source". It also facilitates heightened awareness, enabling one to become "awake" even in dreams. The ultimate state involves an "inner rebirth" where the self becomes identified as light.
*   **Total Acceptance**: The practice aligns with Tantra's foundational principle of **total acceptance** – accepting existence as it is, without struggle or judgment. This acceptance frees up vital energy, redirecting it inwards for transformation.
