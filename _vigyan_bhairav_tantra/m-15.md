### Close all the openings of your head

##### What the Method Is
The core instruction for this meditation technique is: "**Closing the seven openings of the head with your hands, a space between your eyes becomes all inclusive**". This method aims to stop the outward flow of consciousness by blocking the head's sense organs, thereby concentrating awareness internally at the third eye.

##### How It Is Done
To practice this method, follow these steps:
*   **Close the openings**: **Close all the openings of your head** â€“ your eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. You can do this by using your hands to press over the openings, or by using earplugs and an eye mask.
*   **Avoid artificial plugs for nose/mouth**: Do **not use any plugs for the nose or mouth**, as this can be fatal. Instead, use your hands to close them, as this provides a built-in security: if you are about to fall unconscious, your hands will naturally loosen, allowing breathing to resume.
*   **Relax, don't force**: When closing your eyes, **do not force them to close**; instead, relax your face and let the eyelids gently drop. Forcing creates tension and uneasiness.
*   **Embrace darkness**: Once eyes are closed, **imagine a deep, velvety darkness** around and within you. This helps the eyes to stop their natural movements.
*   **Attempt suddenly**: This is a method that is **most helpful when done suddenly**, rather than practiced habitually. It's about creating a "jerk" that breaks old associations and patterns of consciousness. Therefore, you can try it whenever you have time, for a few moments or seconds.
*   **Persist through discomfort**: You may experience a feeling of **suffocation** or **tension/uneasiness**. The instruction is to **persist unless it becomes absolutely unbearable**. The inner force will automatically open the channels if truly necessary. If a strong "hammering" sensation (like a bullet) at the third eye is felt, stop immediately and move your eyes around to release the energy.

##### Commentaries and Insights
*   **Purpose of Centering**: This is one of the **oldest and simplest techniques for centering**. Man often lives on the circumference of his being, always moving outwards; this method helps to reverse that flow and **find the inner center**. All centering methods, regardless of the specific point of focus, ultimately aim to bring consciousness to the navel, the existential root.
*   **The Third Eye**: When all head openings are closed, your consciousness, which normally flows outwards, is suddenly stopped and becomes **concentrated between your two ordinary eyes**, at the spot known as the **third eye**. This third eye, or pineal gland, is described as the **source of consciousness**.
*   **"All Inclusive" Space**: In this state, the inner space (the third eye) becomes "**all inclusive**". This means that experiencing this space allows one to **feel the whole existence within themselves**. While ordinary eyes see the finite and material, the third eye perceives the **infinite, immaterial, and energy itself**.
*   **Mind and Breath Connection**: **Mind and breath are deeply connected**; even stopping your breath for a moment can cause the mind to stop, as mind's movement is conditioned by breathing. This technique leverages this connection to achieve a **thoughtless state of consciousness**, which is defined as meditation.
*   **Transformation and Inner Light**: If you persist through the initial feeling of suffocation and near-death, everything will become **illumined within**. The inner space will feel as if it is spreading, encompassing everything. As psychic energy starts "hammering" at the third eye, you may feel **warmth and a flowing fire**, followed by a profound coldness once the energy is released. This signifies a **complete inner rebirth and liberation**, where the self is identified as light and becomes omnipresent.
*   **No Death, Just Awareness**: Osho reassures that one **cannot die from simply closing the openings**, despite the sensation of being on the verge of death. This intense moment of perceived death, where the mind's normal functioning is interrupted, creates a flash of alertness, a glimpse of samadhi (spiritual health).
*   **Not for Practice**: This is a "sudden jerk" method. If routinely *practiced*, it can become a mechanical habit and lose its transformative power. It's meant to be a spontaneous interruption of the usual flow of consciousness.
*   **Role of the Master**: While these are generalized methods you can try, for deeper and safer results, **initiation by a living master** is emphasized. A master can personalize the technique, ensure it suits your unique being, and provide guidance during potential intense experiences. A master can also create situations to induce these sudden "stop" moments to aid the disciple.
*   **Tantra's Approach**: Tantra values the body as a **vehicle for the spirit**, recognizing the intimate link between physiological and psychological states. It teaches acceptance of what is, including the body and its processes, as a framework for transformation. Tantra is a science that provides techniques to go beyond the mind, enabling direct experience rather than just intellectual understanding.
