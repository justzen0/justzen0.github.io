### Think of the world as an illusion

This meditation method, often associated with the philosophy of *maya*, is a technique to fundamentally shift one's perception of reality, moving beyond the transient and often problematic nature of perceived experience to reveal a deeper, stable truth.

##### What the Method Is

The core instruction or sutra for this method is: **"Illusions deceive, colors circumscribe, even divisibles are indivisible."**. Fundamentally, it instructs one to **"think of it as a dream"** and consider that **"the whole world is illusory"**.

##### How It Is Done

To practise "Think of the world as an illusion," the guidance involves:

*   **Adopt the attitude**: Begin by **acting and behaving as if the entire world is merely a dream**. This is not a philosophical argument but a practical device.
*   **Constant remembrance**: Whatever activity you are engaged in – whether eating, walking, or any other worldly activity – **continuously remember that "this is a dream"**. This must be done without actively trying to change anything in the dream itself, as that would imply a belief in its reality.
*   **Sustain the attitude**: **Try to remember for three weeks continuously** that whatsoever you are doing is just a dream.
*   **Go deep into the feeling**: **"Go deep in this feeling"** that everything is an illusion. This involves moving beyond mere intellectual thought and into a direct, non-verbal sensation of unreality.

##### Commentaries and Insights

Osho's commentaries offer a profound understanding of this method, linking it to various spiritual concepts and practical implications:

*   **Understanding Maya**:
    *   The term *maya* (illusion) in Tantra does **not mean "unreal"** in the conventional sense. Instead, it signifies an **"impossibility to decide whether it is real or unreal"**. It is a state of confusion.
    *   The world is described as being like **rainbows**, appearing to be real but dissolving upon closer inspection. It is a **flux of constant change**, making nothing truly certain.
    *   This view resonates with modern scientific uncertainty, where deeper investigation reveals the indeterminate nature of reality.
    *   The **universe is a reflection of minds**. Each individual creates and lives in their own dream world, a unique psychological reality.
*   **Purpose and Outcome of the Practice**:
    *   This technique is a **"device"** designed to **change the mind's fixed attitude** that everything is real.
    *   If practised consistently for approximately three weeks, the practitioner will **suddenly remember that they are dreaming even while in a night dream**.
    *   Once this is achieved, the practitioner will then spontaneously **realise that their waking life is also a dream**, without needing conscious effort. They will feel as though they are "simply getting up from one dreaming to another".
    *   This shift in perception enables consciousness to become **"double-arrowed"**, meaning it can simultaneously perceive the world as a dream and the self as real.
    *   By understanding dreams as dreams, the practitioner begins to feel the **"dreamer" (the subject)**, leading to the eruption of their true reality.
    *   It helps to **reduce and eventually cease inner dreaming** and projections, both day and night. An enlightened person does not dream because they are always conscious, even in sleep, and have no "suspended experiences" (incomplete actions or thoughts) to complete in dreams.
    *   The technique facilitates a profound entry into the **"here and now"**.
    *   The ultimate aim is to turn consciousness inwards to find the **"knower"** (the true self), which is the only certainty in existence, as even a false dream requires a real dreamer.
    *   When the "false center" (ego or mind's identification) breaks and the individual is rooted in their true being, the world transforms and is perceived as **nirvana**. This is seeing things as they truly are.
    *   If you are internally real, the external world naturally appears unreal.
*   **Connections to Other Traditions and Concepts**:
    *   **Shankara** based his entire philosophy of *maya* on this technique, viewing it not as a mere theory but as a direct inner experience.
    *   **Nagarjuna** also espoused the world as a dream, arising from the experience of becoming a witness to it.
    *   This method is contrasted with **Gurdjieff's "self-remembering"** ("I am"). While "Think of the world as an illusion" makes the world unreal to discover the self, "I am" makes the self real, which in turn makes the world unreal. Both methods ultimately aim for a state where either the individual or the dreams can be perceived as real, but not both simultaneously. "I am" is a non-verbal feeling, not a repetition of words.
    *   It also relates to the idea of life as a **"psychodrama"** or "picture show," where one can become an observer rather than being identified with the role. By viewing life as a drama, one becomes less serious and opens up to happiness. This detachment creates a necessary "distance" between the self and the perceived reality, allowing one to observe rather than be consumed by it.
*   **Challenges and Warnings**:
    *   The simplicity of the instruction can be deceptive. The mind often dismisses such seemingly simple techniques, as the ego seeks difficult challenges to feel fulfilled.
    *   It is crucial not to misinterpret *maya* philosophically and cease engaging with the world (e.g., stopping eating). The goal is to change perception, not action.
    *   Simply repeating the concept of illusion or unreality without actual experience is "parrot-like speech" and does not lead to transformation; it is merely a false intellectual understanding. True insight into its illusory nature is accompanied by the disappearance of worldly misery.
    *   Mind is tricky and will rationalise to avoid doing the technique, suggesting it is "too simple" or "not for you".
    *   It is vital not to introduce personal interpretations or "dreams" into the practice; otherwise, it becomes a "beautiful, spiritual dream" rather than genuine insight.
