### The limits of perception

##### What the method is

The method of "The limits of perception" is based on the understanding that human perception, as filtered through the senses and the mind, inherently distorts and limits the experience of reality. The core instruction, derived from sutras such as "Illusions deceive, colors circumscribe, even divisibles are indivisible", emphasizes recognizing that what appears as distinct, defined, or real through ordinary perception is often an illusion. This prevents direct experience of the indivisible, unified truth of existence. The goal is to move beyond these sensory and mental filters to encounter reality as it truly is, without distortion.

##### How it is done

This method is practiced by consciously engaging in techniques that aim to **suspend or transcend the ordinary functioning of the senses and mind**, leading to an unmediated form of perception or direct knowing:

- **Unlearning Conditioned Perception**: The practitioner must actively cease the mind's habitual tendency to **label, judge, or categorize phenomena**. Instead of applying preconceptions, the aim is to remain "silent, non-condemnatory, non-justifying" when observing the world. This means encountering facts directly without interpreting them through "ideologies, theories, isms, doctrines, beliefs".
- **Focusing Beyond the Object**: When perceiving something through the senses (seeing, hearing, tasting, etc.), the practitioner learns to **focus beyond the mere physical object or sensation**. This involves looking at an object "without seeing the sides or the material", perceiving it freshly "as if for the first time", or trying to find its "essence". Similarly, with sounds, the practice involves listening not just to the external sound but to the underlying "soundlessness" or the "composite central sound" within it. This cultivates a penetration "into the inner world".
- **Self-Remembering (Being Aware of "I Am")**: A fundamental practice involves cultivating **continuous awareness of one's own being ("I am")** during all daily activities, such as singing, seeing, or tasting. This shifts attention from external objects or internal thoughts back to the subject—the one who is perceiving—to realize that the "looker is never the looked at" and is "different from the object". This is not a mental verbalization of "I am" but a direct feeling of one's presence.
- **Transcending Mental Constructs**: Techniques involve actively quieting the mind, allowing thoughts to pass without identification, or observing the "gap" between thoughts or breaths where the mind naturally pauses. The goal is to move towards a state of "no-mind," where the barrier of thought is dissolved, allowing for direct perception of reality.
- **Accepting Paradoxes**: The method encourages an acceptance of apparent contradictions or polarities (e.g., life and death, pleasure and pain, good and bad) as facets of an indivisible reality. This "total acceptance" is crucial because it relaxes the mind, freeing energy that would otherwise be spent in internal conflict and judgment.

##### Commentaries and Insights

- **Mind as a Filter and Mediator**: Osho emphasizes that the **mind acts as a mediator or filter** between oneself and reality, inherently distorting perception. The world perceived through the mind is "problematic" because the mind "divides and creates problems" out of an inherently simple and unproblematic reality. Thoughts themselves are seen as "barriers" that prevent direct encounter with reality, creating a "wall of thoughts" between the individual and truth.
- **Limitations of the Senses**: The ordinary senses are mere "openings" or "receptors" that provide limited, fragmented information. They are bound to the "finite" and "material" aspects of existence, preventing the perception of the infinite, immaterial, or spiritual dimensions that the "third eye" can access. Consciousness naturally flows outwards through the senses to interact with the world, but this external orientation prevents inner knowing.
- **Maya (Illusion) and the Search for the Dreamer**: The concept of _maya_ (illusion) in Tantra does not imply that the world is non-existent, but rather that its true nature cannot be discerned through ordinary, sense-based perception. What appears real through dreams can also appear real in waking life, indicating the **mind's inability to distinguish between reality and illusion**. The true spiritual quest is not about discerning the reality of the perceived world, but about searching for the "dreamer," the "observer," or the "seer" behind all perception.
- **Purpose of Meditative Techniques**: All meditative techniques, including those related to perception, are fundamentally "unconditionings". They aim to remove the "dust" of accumulated past knowledge, experiences, and memories that cover the original, pure mind. By breaking identification with the "false ego" or "mind", these techniques allow the individual to plunge into the "here and now," where the true being resides.
- **Reality is Simple, Mind Creates Complexity**: Osho stresses that **reality is "absolutely unproblematic" and "simple"**. The complexity we experience is a creation of the mind, which thrives on division and argumentation. By dropping this mental activity, the inherent simplicity of existence is revealed.
- **Direct Experience and Choiceless Awareness**: Tantra prioritizes **direct, existential experience** over intellectual understanding or philosophical concepts. Techniques that encourage "choiceless awareness" or "witnessing consciousness" are crucial because they enable the practitioner to observe inner and outer phenomena without attachment or repulsion. This non-judgmental observation allows energies (like anger or desire) to return to their source rather than being suppressed or expressed.
- **Transformation through Acceptance**: The principle of "no-fight" and **total acceptance** are central to Tantra's approach. By accepting "whatsoever you are" without judgment, inner divisions dissolve, leading to wholeness and allowing energy to be transformed and to accumulate. This process can lead to a profound "inner rebirth" and liberation, where the individual identifies with light and becomes "omnipresent". The effort involved is initially a "starter" to reach a state of "effortless, passive awareness" or "beingness," where spiritual experiences manifest spontaneously.
