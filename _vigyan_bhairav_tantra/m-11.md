### Close your senses, become stone-like

##### What the Method Is
This meditation method, titled "Close your senses, become stone-like" in the table of contents, is directly articulated by Osho with the core instruction: "**Stop the doors of the senses when feeling the creeping of an ant. Then.**".

##### How It Is Done
To practice this method, follow these steps:
*   **Choose an object or sensation**: While the sutra uses the example of "the creeping of an ant," Osho clarifies that **any experience, pain, or sensation will serve as the object** for this meditation. This includes having a thorn in your foot, a headache, or any pain in the body.
*   **Stop all sensory input**: The primary action is to **"stop all the doors of the senses"**. This means consciously closing them off:
    *   Close your eyes and **imagine or believe that you are blind and cannot see**.
    *   Close your ears and **imagine that you cannot hear**.
    *   Apply this principle to **all five senses**, effectively shutting them off from external input.
*   **Induce a state of stillness**: A practical way to achieve this immediate closing of senses is to **stop breathing for a single moment**; Osho explains that all your senses will automatically close.
*   **Adopt a "dead" or "stone-like" posture/feeling**: **Imagine that you are dead**, a stone, or a statue. In this state, you cannot move your body, your eyes, cry, or scream; you are simply dead.
*   **Maintain non-cooperation with the body**: **Do not deceive yourself** by subtly cooperating with the body, such as making slight movements or adjustments for comfort. If a mosquito bites, treat the body as if it is dead and do not react.
*   **Accept any arising emotions**: Should **fear, anger, frustration, sadness, or anguish arise** in the mind during this "dead" state, **"stay so"**. As the body is "dead," you cannot act upon these emotions; simply remain with them.
*   **Do not "practice" it mechanically**: This is not a technique for gradual practice but a **"sudden method"** that requires a "sudden jerk" of consciousness. Try it spontaneously whenever possible, suddenly closing all sensory openings for a few moments or seconds.
*   **Persist through discomfort (with caution)**: If suffocation arises from holding your breath, **continue "unless it becomes absolutely unbearable."** Osho reassures that the inner force will naturally open the passages when necessary, ensuring safety. The moment of feeling on the "verge of death" is crucial for transformative insight.

##### Commentaries and Insights
*   **Purpose of the Technique**: This method aims to lead the practitioner into a state of **deep relaxation and ease**, effectively **throwing one back upon oneself** by disconnecting from external distractions.
*   **Mechanism of Disconnection**: By stopping breathing and closing the senses, one is **"removed – far away"** from the immediate sensation or external world. Being **"closed to the world"** inherently means being **closed to your own body**, as the body is fundamentally part of the external world. This creates a state akin to a "Leibnizian monad," a unit closed off from external influence.
*   **Achieving Centeredness**: When external movement ceases and sensory doors are closed, the consciousness, which usually flows outwards, is **stopped and remains inward**. This forces attention back to the **inner center**. This sudden cessation of activity creates a **"gap,"** separating the "stopper" (the inner center) from the "stopped" (the body and its impulses).
*   **Transformation of Experience**: As a result of this technique:
    *   Physical sensations like pain will disappear because a "stone body" cannot experience pain.
    *   The external environment—bed, room, or even the whole world—may **"disappear"** from perception.
    *   The experience leads to **"realize"**. If persisted in at the verge of death, everything can become **"illumined,"** and an expansive **"inner space"** will be felt, encompassing the whole existence.
    *   This deep inactivity allows one to **encounter their subtle presence** and realize that they are **"not the body"**. This realization is revolutionary and fundamentally changes one's life.
    *   It helps to overcome the fear of death, as one directly experiences that their true self does not die with the body.
*   **Connection to Other Concepts**: This method is a detailed application of the broader "Stop!" techniques, which Gurdjieff popularized. It highlights the principle of **"suddenness"**: the act of stopping must be instantaneous, without mental planning or adjustment, to create the necessary inner jolt. If performed with alertness and without mental interference, it leads to a **"thoughtless consciousness,"** which is Osho's definition of meditation.
*   **Cautions**: Osho stresses that this is a **"sudden method"** rather than a gradual practice. If mechanically practiced, it risks becoming a mere habit, losing its transformative power. While beneficial, it can be arduous and evoke fear. However, Osho assures that "at least up until now not a single person has died using this method". It's crucial to understand that the technique is designed to push you to the "verge of death" for a glimpse of inner reality, not to actually cause harm.
