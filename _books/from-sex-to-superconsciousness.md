Here are some of the beautiful quotes from the book.
Read, meditate and enjoy.

▪ Love is shut up inside man; it need only be released. The question is not how to produce it, but how 
to uncover it. What have we covered ourselves with? What is it that will not allow love to surface?

▪ Moreover, when are such firm decisions made? When a man makes a firm resolution, like a vow of celibacy for example, it means that his sexuality is pushing desperately from inside. If a man resolves he will eat less or will fast from today on, it implies he has a deep desire to eat more.

▪ Such efforts inevitably result in inner conflict. We are what our weaknesses are. But we decide to curb them; we resolve to fight against them ­ and naturally, this becomes a source of subconscious conflict.

▪ Because of condemnation, sex 
has become an obsession, a disease, a perversion. It has become poisoned.

▪ The stronger a person’s ego is, the harder it is for him to unite with anybody. The ego comes in between; the ”I” asserts itself. It is a wall.

▪ The philosophy of religion has 
always been death-oriented, instead of life-oriented. Religion preaches that what comes after life is  important, but that what happens before death has no significance whatsoever. Up to now, religion 
has revered death, but shown no respect for life. Nowhere is the joyous acceptance of the flowers 
and the fruits of life to be found; everywhere there is an obstinate clinging to dead flowers. Our lives 
are eulogies on the graves of dead flowers!

▪ some people think I am a propagandist for sex. If so, please tell them that they haven’t 
heard me at all. It is difficult these days to find a greater enemy of sex on the face of this earth than 
me. If people can pay attention to what I say ­ without bias ­ it is possible to liberate man from sex. 
This is the only course for a better humanity. The pundits we consider the enemies of sex are not its enemies at all, but its propagandists. They have created a glamour around sex; their vehement  opposition has created a mad attraction for sex.

▪ The deeper a man’s understanding, the higher he can rise above sex; the less his understanding, the greater his attempts to suppress sex will be. And the results of repression are 
never fruitful, never pleasing, never healthy.

▪ man needs to conserve his energy; he needs to allow his energy to grow. To scale truth, to reach to the soul, man must strive to become a reservoir of limitless strength; only 
then can he reach to the eternal. Heaven is not for the weak.

▪ The realization that comes in the moment of orgasm consists of two elements: EGOLESSNESS and TIMELESSNESS. Time freezes and the ego evaporates. Because of the absence of the ego and the stoppage of time, one has a clear vision of one’s own self ­ of one’s real self.

▪ Each child in his tender years should be taught meditation, should be instructed in meditation. False 
teachings against sex should be abolished, and meditation should be taught. Meditation is a positive  door; it is a higher opening. A choice between sex and meditation must be made, and meditation is the superior alternative. Do not condemn sex; teach children to meditate.

▪ The possibility of sex in a man’s life lessens as love increases within him. Love and meditation will open that door which is the door to God. Together, love and meditation touch God, and then celibacy flowers in a man’s life. Then the entire life-force ascends through a new passage. Then it does not leak out gradually; then it never recedes. The energy rises upwards from within; it rises 
on its voyage to heaven.

▪ The day we fully develop a scripture, a science, a complete system of thought on sex, we will 
produce a new race of humans. Then, there won’t be the production of such ugly, insipid, lame and 
feeble human beings. Sick, weak, dull men won’t be seen any more on this earth.

▪ Those who have researched sex, who have gone deeply into it, who have meditated upon life’s manifold experiences, have deduced that if coitus only lasts for one minute a man will desire it again on the next day, but if it can be prolonged for three minutes he will not think of sex for a week to come. Furthermore, they have observed that if coitus can be prolonged for seven minutes, a man will be so free of sex that no thought of passion will arise in him for the next three months. And if the period of coitus can be extended to three hours, a man will be free of sex forever; he will never desire it again!

▪ The deterioration in man is only due to the crassness of our attitude to sex, in theory as well as in  practice. Sex has lost its original sacredness. The original sense of reverence man had for sex has 
been tarnished. Sex has degenerated into a mechanical nightmare. And this attitude to sex betrays a subtle violence, in the strict sense of the term. Sex is no longer an experience of love. Sex is no longer a vehicle to sacredness. Sex is no longer a meditative act. And because of this, mankind is 
falling steadily into an abyss.

▪ Man is such a wonderful animal ­ he enjoys listening to talk about those who are dead, and threatens to kill those who are living.

▪ No one dies by being assassinated; it only helps make a man immortal. Life’s plot is complicated; life’s story is filled with suspense: things are not so simple as they seem. The man who dies in bed dies forever, whereas the man who dies from an assassin’s bullets never dies.
